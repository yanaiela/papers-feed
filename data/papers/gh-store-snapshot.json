        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art\nAI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not\nalways faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive\nat conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in\nunnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we\nshow that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial\nbias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful\nreasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and\nChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs\nunfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit\nbiases in answers to binary questions (\"implicit post-hoc rationalization\").\nFor example, when separately presented with the questions \"Is X bigger than Y?\"\nand \"Is Y bigger than X?\", models sometimes produce superficially coherent\narguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions,\ndespite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate\nrestoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently\ncorrect errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use\nclearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a\nhard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies\non monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.",

        "abstract": "In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to\ndetermine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of \"quality\"\nfrom the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we\nexplore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better\ncontrol in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.\nFirst, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the\ngeometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled\nexperiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic\ndata, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear\nrepresentation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show\nthat although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,\nit also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real\nToxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better\ntrade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general\ncapabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention\n(ITI) are applied.

We study transformers'\nability to learn random $n$-gram LMs of two kinds: ones with arbitrary\nnext-symbol probabilities and ones where those are defined with shared\nparameters.

        "authors": "Chen Qian, Dongrui Liu, Haochen Wen, Zhen Bai, Yong Liu, Jing Shao",
        "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information (MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases. Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall, our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities. The code is available at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by LLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied verbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of controllable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt, integrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To generate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting and combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while maintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts along three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability. Gemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts are coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these outputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing limitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify Frankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between segments, especially in longer generations. Beyond presenting a challenging generation task, Frankentexts invite discussion on building effective detectors for this new grey zone of authorship, provide training data for mixed authorship detection, and serve as a sandbox for studying human-AI co-writing processes.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance in\naligning visual and textual representations, excelling in tasks like image\nretrieval and zero-shot classification. Despite this success, the mechanisms by\nwhich these models utilize training data, particularly the role of\nmemorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and\nself-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for\ngeneralization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would\napply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via\ncaptions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from\nself-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in\nunderstanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem)\nand use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that\nCLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised\nparadigms, with \"mis-captioned\" samples exhibiting highest levels of\nmemorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to\nmemorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies\nshould focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose\nmultiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving\nutility--something that had not been shown before for traditional learning\nparadigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease.",

CREATIVITY INDEX is motivated by the hypothesis that\nthe seemingly remarkable creativity of LLMs may be attributable in large part\nto the creativity of human-written texts on the web. To compute CREATIVITY\nINDEX efficiently, we introduce DJ SEARCH, a novel dynamic programming\nalgorithm that can search verbatim and near-verbatim matches of text snippets\nfrom a given document against the web. Experiments reveal that the CREATIVITY\nINDEX of professional human authors is on average 66.2% higher than that of\nLLMs, and that alignment reduces the CREATIVITY INDEX of LLMs by an average of\n30.1%. In addition, we find that distinguished authors like Hemingway exhibit\nmeasurably higher CREATIVITY INDEX compared to other human writers. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that CREATIVITY INDEX can be used as a surprisingly effective\ncriterion for zero-shot machine text detection, surpassing the strongest\nexisting zero-shot system, DetectGPT, by a significant margin of 30.2%, and\neven outperforming the strongest supervised system, GhostBuster, in five out of\nsix domains.",

To address this challenge, we introduce\nScylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the\ngeneralization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from\nmemorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between\ntask complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term\nthe generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical\nthreshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on\nnon-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs'\ngeneralization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity\nshifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models\ncan handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization.\nLeveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs\nincluding both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and\nclose-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation\nand establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.",

        "abstract": "The 1st Workshop on Data Contamination (CONDA 2024) focuses on all relevant aspects of data contamination in natural language processing, where data contamination is understood as situations where evaluation data is included in pre-training corpora used to train large scale models, compromising evaluation results. The workshop fostered a shared task to collect evidence on data contamination in current available datasets and models. The goal of the shared task and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the extent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting evaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a structured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination evidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests. This first compilation paper is based on 566 reported entries over 91 contaminated sources from a total of 23 contributors. The details of the individual contamination events are available in the platform. The platform continues to be online, open to contributions from the community.",

        "abstract": "With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.",

This work moves beyond the final-answer\naccuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and\nmathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into\ntwo parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained\nevaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used\n(measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured\nby Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled\nand base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or\nreinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing\nfindings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do\nnot transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2)\nSFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of\nreasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained\nmodels; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain\nknowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning\ninaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both\nreasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.",

Our findings\nindicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging\nLLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning. Furthermore, we explored how\ncontextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process\nto gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs.\nCode and data will be available soon.",

        "abstract": "Large language models learn and continually learn through the accumulation of\ngradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect\nexisting knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic\nhallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new\ninformation, LLMs exhibit a \"priming\" effect: learning a new fact can cause the\nmodel to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To\nsystematically study this phenomenon, we introduce \"Outlandish,\" a carefully\ncurated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new\nknowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this\ndataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can\nbe predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning.\nThis relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2,\nGemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel\ntechniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a\n``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update\npruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\\%\nwhile preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings\nprovide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for\nimproving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

        "abstract": "How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when\nthose beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of\nunderstanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze\nLlama-3-70B-Instruct's ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal\nmediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset that consists of simple\nstories where two characters each separately change the state of two objects,\npotentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovered a\npervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables\nthe LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds\neach character-object-state triple together by co-locating reference\ninformation about them, represented as their Ordering IDs (OIs) in low rank\nsubspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's\nbeliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the\ncorresponding state OI and then an answer lookback retrieves the state token.\nWhen we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the\nother, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the\nrelation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility\nlookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character\nand update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into\nthe LM's belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering\nToM reasoning in LMs.",

We find that\nundisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are\nable to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if\ndesired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best\nscore leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance\nresults. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in\nthe lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed\nmodels are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models\nremoved from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both\nthese policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like\nGoogle and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the\narena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only\nreceived an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot\nArena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result\nin relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on\nour conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to\nArena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality.

        "abstract": "Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.",

        "abstract": "The alignment tuning process of large language models (LLMs) typically\ninvolves instruction learning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\npreference tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). A\nrecent study, LIMA (Zhou et al. 2023), shows that using merely 1K examples for\nSFT can achieve significant alignment performance as well, suggesting that the\neffect of alignment tuning might be \"superficial.\" This raises questions about\nhow exactly the alignment tuning transforms a base LLM.\n  We analyze the effect of alignment tuning by examining the token distribution\nshift between base LLMs and their aligned counterpart. Our findings reveal that\nbase LLMs and their alignment-tuned versions perform nearly identically in\ndecoding on the majority of token positions. Most distribution shifts occur\nwith stylistic tokens. These direct evidence strongly supports the Superficial\nAlignment Hypothesis suggested by LIMA.\n  Based on these findings, we rethink the alignment of LLMs by posing the\nresearch question: how effectively can we align base LLMs without SFT or RLHF?\nTo address this, we introduce a simple, tuning-free alignment method, URIAL.\nURIAL achieves effective alignment purely through in-context learning (ICL)\nwith base LLMs, requiring as few as three constant stylistic examples and a\nsystem prompt. We conduct a fine-grained and interpretable evaluation on a\ndiverse set of examples, named JUST-EVAL-INSTRUCT. Results demonstrate that\nbase LLMs with URIAL can match or even surpass the performance of LLMs aligned\nwith SFT or SFT+RLHF. We show that the gap between tuning-free and tuning-based\nalignment methods can be significantly reduced through strategic prompting and\nICL. Our findings on the superficial nature of alignment tuning and results\nwith URIAL suggest that deeper analysis and theoretical understanding of\nalignment is crucial to future LLM research.",

        "abstract": "We present a framework for large language model (LLM) based data generation\nwith controllable causal structure. In particular, we define a procedure for\nturning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into a\nsequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCM\nis a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structural\nequations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational,\ninterventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired\ncausal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of\nbenchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level\ncounterfactual data without needing to manually specify functional\nrelationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting of\nthousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these\ndatasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect\nestimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generating\ndata, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causal\neffect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditing\nLLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. We\nbelieve SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would\nbenefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.",

Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with\nGPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem\nto reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings.

Therefore, an intuitive way of addressing the above\nquestion is to formalize it as a matter of learnability of classes of\ndistributions over strings. While prior work in this direction focused on\nassessing the theoretical limits, in contrast, we seek to understand the\nempirical learnability. Unlike prior empirical work, we evaluate neural LMs on\ntheir home turf-learning probabilistic languages-rather than as classifiers of\nformal languages. In particular, we investigate the learnability of regular LMs\n(RLMs) by RNN and Transformer LMs. We empirically test the learnability of RLMs\nas a function of various complexity parameters of the RLM and the hidden state\nsize of the neural LM. We find that the RLM rank, which corresponds to the size\nof linear space spanned by the logits of its conditional distributions, and the\nexpected length of sampled strings are strong and significant predictors of\nlearnability for both RNNs and Transformers. Several other predictors also\nreach significance, but with differing patterns between RNNs and Transformers.",

This\nraises the question: what solutions are learned by these shallow and\nnon-recurrent models? We find that a low-depth Transformer can represent the\ncomputations of any finite-state automaton (thus, any bounded-memory\nalgorithm), by hierarchically reparameterizing its recurrent dynamics. Our\ntheoretical results characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a Transformer with\n$o(T)$ layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input\nsequence of length $T$. We find that polynomial-sized $O(\\log T)$-depth\nsolutions always exist; furthermore, $O(1)$-depth simulators are surprisingly\ncommon, and can be understood using tools from Krohn-Rhodes theory and circuit\ncomplexity. Empirically, we perform synthetic experiments by training\nTransformers to simulate a wide variety of automata, and show that shortcut\nsolutions can be learned via standard training.

In this work, we seek inspiration from study of emergent properties in\nother fields and propose a phenomenological definition for the concept in the\ncontext of neural networks. Our definition implicates the acquisition of\ngeneral structures underlying the data-generating process as a cause of sudden\nperformance growth for specific, narrower tasks. We empirically investigate\nthis definition by proposing an experimental system grounded in a\ncontext-sensitive formal language and find that Transformers trained to perform\ntasks on top of strings from this language indeed exhibit emergent\ncapabilities. Specifically, we show that once the language's underlying grammar\nand context-sensitivity inducing structures are learned by the model,\nperformance on narrower tasks suddenly begins to improve.

Despite its clear\nimportance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters\nthe underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does\nfine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing\nones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings\nwhere we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and\nprobing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We\nperform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings,\nand show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities;\n(ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned\non top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they\nhave been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hidden\ncapabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of the\ncapability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a few\ngradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a\nmodel's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially\nunrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language models\ntrained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realistic\nsetup.",

To continue scaling pretraining in this\ndata-constrained regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the\nlatent thoughts that underlie the text generation process can significantly\nimprove pretraining data efficiency. Intuitively, our approach views web text\nas the compressed final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the\nlatent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and reasoning steps that\nare critical to data-efficient learning. We empirically demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach through data-constrained continued pretraining\nfor math. We first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent\nthoughts significantly improve data efficiency, outperforming training on the\nsame amount of raw data (5.7\\% $\\rightarrow$ 25.4\\% on MATH). Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate latent thought inference without a strong teacher, where an LM\nbootstraps its own performance by using an EM algorithm to iteratively improve\nthe capability of the trained LM and the quality of thought-augmented\npretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance across at\nleast three iterations and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw\ndata, with increasing gains from additional inference compute when performing\nthe E-step. The gains from inference scaling and EM iterations suggest new\nopportunities for scaling data-constrained pretraining.",

On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems.\nOn the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans,\ncasting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer\nvolume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the\nmethod traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation.\nTo overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ\nwhen performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely\non. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their\npretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for\nthree simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that\nare influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models\nrely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document\noften has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the\nsame task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find\nthat the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential\ndata. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as\nhighly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps.\nWhen we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions\nqualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain\nprocedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using\nformulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the\nmodels use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that\nsynthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of\nreasoning.",

Our results show that CoT gives\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks.

        "abstract": "Several works have proposed Simplicity Bias (SB)---the tendency of standard\ntraining procedures such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to find simple\nmodels---to justify why neural networks generalize well [Arpit et al. 2017,\nNakkiran et al. 2019, Soudry et al. 2018]. However, the precise notion of\nsimplicity remains vague. Furthermore, previous settings that use SB to\ntheoretically justify why neural networks generalize well do not simultaneously\ncapture the non-robustness of neural networks---a widely observed phenomenon in\npractice [Goodfellow et al. 2014, Jo and Bengio 2017]. We attempt to reconcile\nSB and the superior standard generalization of neural networks with the\nnon-robustness observed in practice by designing datasets that (a) incorporate\na precise notion of simplicity, (b) comprise multiple predictive features with\nvarying levels of simplicity, and (c) capture the non-robustness of neural\nnetworks trained on real data. Through theory and empirics on these datasets,\nwe make four observations: (i) SB of SGD and variants can be extreme: neural\nnetworks can exclusively rely on the simplest feature and remain invariant to\nall predictive complex features. (ii) The extreme aspect of SB could explain\nwhy seemingly benign distribution shifts and small adversarial perturbations\nsignificantly degrade model performance. (iii) Contrary to conventional wisdom,\nSB can also hurt generalization on the same data distribution, as SB persists\neven when the simplest feature has less predictive power than the more complex\nfeatures. (iv) Common approaches to improve generalization and\nrobustness---ensembles and adversarial training---can fail in mitigating SB and\nits pitfalls. Given the role of SB in training neural networks, we hope that\nthe proposed datasets and methods serve as an effective testbed to evaluate\nnovel algorithmic approaches aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of SB.",

        "abstract": "We obtain an analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in\nconvolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-matching diffusion models can\ngenerate highly original images that lie far from their training data. However,\noptimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to\nproduce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap,\nwe identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1)\ninduce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching;\n(2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local\nscore (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after\ncalibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict\nthe outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and\nUNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top\nmodel on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally\nconsistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models\ncreate exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local\ntraining set patches at different scales and image locations. Our theory also\npartially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets\n(median $r^2 \\sim 0.77$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention\nin carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.",

        "abstract": "Many popular feature-attribution methods for interpreting deep neural\nnetworks rely on computing the gradients of a model's output with respect to\nits inputs. While these methods can indicate which input features may be\nimportant for the model's prediction, they reveal little about the inner\nworkings of the model itself. In this paper, we observe that the gradient\ncomputation of a model is a special case of a more general formulation using\nsemirings. This observation allows us to generalize the backpropagation\nalgorithm to efficiently compute other interpretable statistics about the\ngradient graph of a neural network, such as the highest-weighted path and\nentropy. We implement this generalized algorithm, evaluate it on synthetic\ndatasets to better understand the statistics it computes, and apply it to study\nBERT's behavior on the subject-verb number agreement task (SVA). With this\nmethod, we (a) validate that the amount of gradient flow through a component of\na model reflects its importance to a prediction and (b) for SVA, identify which\npathways of the self-attention mechanism are most important.",

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly relied on in AI systems,\npredicting when they make mistakes is crucial. While a great deal of work in\nthe field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these\nrepresentations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an\nAPI. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using\nfollow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as\nrepresentations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate\nthat training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces\nreliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance\nlevel (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question).\nRemarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate\nover a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In\naddition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate\nmore nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be\nused to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that\nhas been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers\nquestion-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code.\nFurthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model\narchitectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models\nprovided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of\nGPT-4o-mini).",

        "abstract": "Recent work claims that large language models display emergent abilities,\nabilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale\nmodels. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness,\ntransitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their\nunpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we\npresent an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a\nparticular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent\nabilities appear due to the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to\nfundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or\ndiscontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or\ncontinuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model\nperformance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical\nmodel, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm\nthree predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3\nfamily on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two\npredictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on\nBIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen\nseemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep\nnetworks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent\nabilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may\nnot be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.",

In this paper, we try to answer this\nquestion by exploring a mechanistic interpretation of LMs for multi-step\nreasoning tasks. Concretely, we hypothesize that the LM implicitly embeds a\nreasoning tree resembling the correct reasoning process within it. We test this\nhypothesis by introducing a new probing approach (called MechanisticProbe) that\nrecovers the reasoning tree from the model's attention patterns. We use our\nprobe to analyze two LMs: GPT-2 on a synthetic task (k-th smallest element),\nand LLaMA on two simple language-based reasoning tasks (ProofWriter & AI2\nReasoning Challenge). We show that MechanisticProbe is able to detect the\ninformation of the reasoning tree from the model's attentions for most\nexamples, suggesting that the LM indeed is going through a process of\nmulti-step reasoning within its architecture in many cases.",

        "authors": "Tianyu He, Darshil Doshi, Aritra Das, Andrey Gromov",
        "abstract": "Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training\nset. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill\ncomposition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and\nskill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we\nconsider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \\, x + b \\, y\n\\;\\mathrm{mod}\\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use\nsome of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution\ntesting. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition\nfrom in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of\npre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of\nout-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for\ndeeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is\n\\emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an\ninterpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing highly structured\nrepresentations in both attention heads and MLPs; and discuss the learned\nalgorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper models, as we go\nfrom few to many in-context examples.",

        "authors": "Taywon Min, Haeone Lee, Yongchan Kwon, Kimin Lee",
        "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn\nsuitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models\n(LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy,\ninconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such\nfeedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended\nside effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore\nthe use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the\nperformance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation\nmethod that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward\nmodels and large-scale preference datasets. In our experiments, we demonstrate\ntwo key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common forms of\nlabeler bias in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers to refine\ntheir strategies to align more closely with expert feedback. By quantifying the\nimpact of human feedback on reward models, we believe that influence functions\ncan enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in\nRLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of multimodal generative models has sparked critical\ndiscussions on their reliability, fairness and potential for misuse. While\ntext-to-image models excel at producing high-fidelity, user-guided content,\nthey often exhibit unpredictable behaviors and vulnerabilities that can be\nexploited to manipulate class or concept representations. To address this, we\npropose an evaluation framework to assess model reliability by analyzing\nresponses to global and local perturbations in the embedding space, enabling\nthe identification of inputs that trigger unreliable or biased behavior. Beyond\nsocial implications, fairness and diversity are fundamental to defining robust\nand trustworthy model behavior. Our approach offers deeper insights into these\nessential aspects by evaluating: (i) generative diversity, measuring the\nbreadth of visual representations for learned concepts, and (ii) generative\nfairness, which examines the impact that removing concepts from input prompts\nhas on control, under a low guidance setup. Beyond these evaluations, our\nmethod lays the groundwork for detecting unreliable, bias-injected models and\ntracing the provenance of embedded biases.

        "authors": "Amanda Myntti, Erik Henriksson, Veronika Laippala, Sampo Pyysalo",
        "abstract": "Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM)\ndevelopment, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web\ncorpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets\nare divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the\nfilters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or\ndetrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of\ndifferent kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this\narticle, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres)\n- a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation -\nto curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the\nperformance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with\nregister classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and\nshow that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model\nperformance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining\nmaterial and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar\nperformance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts\nsuch as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained\non the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited\nto a single register, combining well-performing registers like\nHow-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major\nimprovements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key\ndifferences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as\npretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer\nof model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection\npractices.",

        "authors": "Chirag Agarwal, Sree Harsha Tanneru, Himabindu Lakkaraju",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as powerful tools for several\nnatural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent works show that modern\nLLMs can generate self-explanations (SEs), which elicit their intermediate\nreasoning steps for explaining their behavior. Self-explanations have seen\nwidespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature.\nHowever, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this\nwork, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs\ngenerated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible\nexplanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these\nexplanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs,\nraising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend\ntowards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the\ndemand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their\nfaithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in\nLLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need\nfor a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of\ndifferent real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs.\nWhile there are several approaches to improving plausibility, improving\nfaithfulness is an open challenge. We call upon the community to develop novel\nmethods to enhance the faithfulness of self explanations thereby enabling\ntransparent deployment of LLMs in diverse high-stakes settings.",

        "authors": "Jinya Sakurai, Issei Sato",
        "abstract": "The proliferation of Text-to-Image (T2I) models has revolutionized content\ncreation, providing powerful tools for diverse applications ranging from\nartistic expression to educational material development and marketing. Despite\nthese technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these\nmodels' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal\nbiases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is\nincluded in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes\nin the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel\nframework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social\nbiases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an\nLLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in\ngenerated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module\nthat fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate\nidentified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and\ndatasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining\nhigh-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and\nquantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space,\nbuilding upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our\nresults show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the\ndiversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate,\nusing the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are\nchallenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond\noccupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new\nbenchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.",

This involves identifying\nand removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's\nperformance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,\nthe model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies\nin removing only the target information while leaving other information\nunchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a\nwidely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to\nrepresentations when eliminating target information.

        "authors": "Anna Soligo, Edward Turner, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda",
        "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to\ndevelop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent\nmisalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it\ngeneralizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating\ncritical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and\nstudy a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently\nmisalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently\nmisaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We\ndemonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one\nfine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned\nbehaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different\ndatasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further\npresent a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning\nadapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two\nspecialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent\nmisalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected\nmodel behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,\nwe hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate\nmisalignment more generally.",

        "abstract": "The era of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for interpretability--agentic interpretability: a multi-turn conversation with an LLM wherein the LLM proactively assists human understanding by developing and leveraging a mental model of the user, which in turn enables humans to develop better mental models of the LLM. Such conversation is a new capability that traditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do not use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just knowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well, understanding that their success will be measured by the student's comprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for interactivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with potentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover potentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of machines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in evaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans responses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation difficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach human parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help humans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see us fall increasingly far from understanding them.",

        "authors": "Hao Xu, Jiacheng Liu, Yejin Choi, Noah A. Smith, Hannaneh Hajishirzi",
        "abstract": "Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet,\nand it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source.\nExact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting\nstring appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high\nstorage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present\nInfini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level\ntext corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and\nManzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system\ncreates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly\nimproves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing\nspeed (18$\\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\\times$ reduction)\nand querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in\n50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes).\nWe show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of\nbenchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be\nheavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead\nto overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data.\nWe host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of\nmany core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface\nand an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini\nindexes.",

        "authors": "Yi Ren, Danica J. Sutherland",
        "abstract": "Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, \ngives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique ``squeezing effect'' to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.",

        "authors": "Daniel Halpern, Evi Micha, Ariel D. Procaccia, Itai Shapira",
        "abstract": "Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable\nbehavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and\ncultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and\nminority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting\ndiverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward\nfunctions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned\ndirectly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined\ngroups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft\nlabels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of\ncandidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response\nmatches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a\nsmall outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference\ndistributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training\nheuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through\nimproved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic\nvalues.",

        "abstract": "Language models today are widely used in education, yet their ability to\ntailor responses for learners with varied informational needs and knowledge\nbackgrounds remains under-explored. To this end, we introduce ELI-Why, a\nbenchmark of 13.4K \"Why\" questions to evaluate the pedagogical capabilities of\nlanguage models. We then conduct two extensive human studies to assess the\nutility of language model-generated explanatory answers (explanations) on our\nbenchmark, tailored to three distinct educational grades: elementary,\nhigh-school and graduate school. In our first study, human raters assume the\nrole of an \"educator\" to assess model explanations' fit to different\neducational grades. We find that GPT-4-generated explanations match their\nintended educational background only 50% of the time, compared to 79% for lay\nhuman-curated explanations. In our second study, human raters assume the role\nof a learner to assess if an explanation fits their own informational needs.\nAcross all educational backgrounds, users deemed GPT-4-generated explanations\n20% less suited on average to their informational needs, when compared to\nexplanations curated by lay people. Additionally, automated evaluation metrics\nreveal that explanations generated across different language model families for\ndifferent informational needs remain indistinguishable in their grade-level,\nlimiting their pedagogical effectiveness.",

        "authors": "Jacob Pfau, William Merrill, Samuel R. Bowman",
        "abstract": "Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across\nmost benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance\ngains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater\ncomputation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use\nmeaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to\nsolve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without\nintermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler\ntokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We\nalso provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where\nfiller tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order\nformula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens\nneed not provide information about the intermediate computational steps\ninvolved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that\nadditional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token\nchoice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises\nconcerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden\ncomputations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought\ntokens.",

        "authors": "Deven R. Desai, Mark Riedl",
        "abstract": "Copyright and computer science continue to intersect and clash, but they can coexist. The advent of new technologies such as digitization of visual and aural creations, sharing technologies, search engines, social media offerings, and more challenge copyright-based industries and reopen questions about the reach of copyright law. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research, especially Large Language Models that leverage copyrighted material as part of training models, are the latest examples of the ongoing tension between copyright and computer science. The exuberance, rush-to-market, and edge problem cases created by a few misguided companies now raises challenges to core legal doctrines and may shift Open Internet practices for the worse. That result does not have to be, and should not be, the outcome.\nThis Article shows that, contrary to some scholars' views, fair use law does not bless all ways that someone can gain access to copyrighted material even when the purpose is fair use. Nonetheless, the scientific need for more data to advance AI research means access to large book corpora and the Open Internet is vital for the future of that research. The copyright industry claims, however, that almost all uses of copyrighted material must be compensated, even for non-expressive uses. The Article's solution accepts that both sides need to change. It is one that forces the computer science world to discipline its behaviors and, in some cases, pay for copyrighted material. It also requires the copyright industry to abandon its belief that all uses must be compensated or restricted to uses sanctioned by the copyright industry. As part of this re-balancing, the Article addresses a problem that has grown out of this clash and under theorized.",

        "abstract": "We present a system that allows a user to search a large linguistically annotated corpus using syntactic patterns over dependency graphs. In contrast to previous attempts to this effect, we introduce a light-weight query language that does not require the user to know the details of the underlying syntactic representations, and instead to query the corpus by providing an example sentence coupled with simple markup. Search is performed at an interactive speed due to an efficient linguistic graph-indexing and retrieval engine. This allows for rapid exploration, development and refinement of syntax-based queries. We demonstrate the system using queries over two corpora: the English wikipedia, and a collection of English pubmed abstracts. A demo of the wikipedia system is available at: this https URL",

        "authors": "Royi Rassin, Aviv Slobodkin, Shauli Ravfogel, Yanai Elazar, Yoav Goldberg",
        "abstract": "We introduce GRADE, an automatic method for quantifying sample diversity in text-to-image models. Our method leverages the world knowledge embedded in large language models and visual question-answering systems to identify relevant concept-specific axes of diversity (e.g., ``shape'' for the concept ``cookie''). It then estimates frequency distributions of concepts and their attributes and quantifies diversity using entropy. We use GRADE to measure the diversity of 12 models over a total of 720K images, revealing that all models display limited variation, with clear deterioration in stronger models. Further, we find that models often exhibit default behaviors, a phenomenon where a model consistently generates concepts with the same attributes (e.g., 98% of the cookies are round). Lastly, we show that a key reason for low diversity is underspecified captions in training data. Our work proposes an automatic, semantically-driven approach to measure sample diversity and highlights the stunning homogeneity in text-to-image models.",

        "abstract": "Scaling laws guide the development of large language models (LLMs) by offering estimates for the optimal balance of model size, tokens, and compute. More recently, loss-to-loss scaling laws that relate losses across pretraining datasets and downstream tasks have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding and improving LLM performance. In this work, we investigate which factors most strongly influence loss-to-loss scaling. Our experiments reveal that the pretraining data and tokenizer determine the scaling trend. In contrast, model size, optimization hyperparameters, and even significant architectural differences, such as between transformer-based models like Llama and state-space models like Mamba, have limited impact. Consequently, practitioners should carefully curate suitable pretraining datasets for optimal downstream performance, while architectures and other settings can be freely optimized for training efficiency.",

        "authors": "Wenjie Ma, Jingxuan He, Charlie Snell, Tyler Griggs, Sewon Min, Matei Zaharia",
        "abstract": "Recent LLMs have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, primarily by including an explicit, lengthy Thinking process as part of generation. In this paper, we question whether this explicit thinking is necessary. Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use task-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, our research encourages a reconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also establishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance in low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling.",

        "abstract": "Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.",

        "authors": "Charaka Vinayak Kumar, Ashok Urlana, Gopichand Kanumolu, Bala Mallikarjunarao Garlapati, Pruthwik Mishra",
        "abstract": "Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the performance of different natural language understanding as well as generation tasks. Although LLMs have breached the state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they often reflect different forms of bias present in the training data. In the light of this perceived limitation, we provide a unified evaluation of benchmarks using a set of representative small and medium-sized LLMs that cover different forms of biases starting from physical characteristics to socio-economic categories. Moreover, we propose five prompting approaches to carry out the bias detection task across different aspects of bias. Further, we formulate three research questions to gain valuable insight in detecting biases in LLMs using different approaches and evaluation metrics across benchmarks. The results indicate that each of the selected LLMs suffer from one or the other form of bias with the Phi-3.5B model being the least biased. Finally, we conclude the paper with the identification of key challenges and possible future directions.",

        "authors": "Sai Sumedh R. Hindupur, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Thomas Fel, Demba Ba",
        "abstract": "Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to interpret neural networks by identifying meaningful concepts from their representations. However, do SAEs truly uncover all concepts a model relies on, or are they inherently biased toward certain kinds of concepts? We introduce a unified framework that recasts SAEs as solutions to a bilevel optimization problem, revealing a fundamental challenge: each SAE imposes structural assumptions about how concepts are encoded in model representations, which in turn shapes what it can and cannot detect. This means different SAEs are not interchangeable -- switching architectures can expose entirely new concepts or obscure existing ones. To systematically probe this effect, we evaluate SAEs across a spectrum of settings: from controlled toy models that isolate key variables, to semi-synthetic experiments on real model activations and finally to large-scale, naturalistic datasets. Across this progression, we examine two fundamental properties that real-world concepts often exhibit: heterogeneity in intrinsic dimensionality (some concepts are inherently low-dimensional, others are not) and nonlinear separability. We show that SAEs fail to recover concepts when these properties are ignored, and we design a new SAE that explicitly incorporates both, enabling the discovery of previously hidden concepts and reinforcing our theoretical insights. Our findings challenge the idea of a universal SAE and underscores the need for architecture-specific choices in model interpretability. Overall, we argue an SAE does not just reveal concepts -- it determines what can be seen at all.",

        "abstract": "Improvements in language model capabilities are often attributed to increasing model size or training data, but in some cases smaller models trained on curated data or with different architectural decisions can outperform larger ones trained on more tokens. What accounts for this? To quantify the impact of these design choices, we meta-analyze 92 open-source pretrained models across a wide array of scales, including state-of-the-art open-weights models as well as less performant models and those with less conventional design decisions. We find that by incorporating features besides model size and number of training tokens, we can achieve a relative 3-28% increase in ability to predict downstream performance compared with using scale alone. Analysis of model design decisions reveal insights into data composition, such as the trade-off between language and code tasks at 15-25\\% code, as well as the better performance of some architectural decisions such as choosing rotary over learned embeddings. Broadly, our framework lays a foundation for more systematic investigation of how model development choices shape final capabilities.",

We introduce FairCoT,\na novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain\nof Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models.\nFairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and\ndynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and\nequitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative\nreasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in\nsensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility.\nExperimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE\nand various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly\nenhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic\nfidelity.

In this paper we introduce the architecture of Bluesky and the AT Protocol, and explain how the technical design of Bluesky is informed by our goals: to enable decentralization by having multiple interoperable providers for every part of the system; to make it easy for users to switch providers; to give users agency over the content they see; and to provide a simple user experience that does not burden users with complexity arising from the system's decentralized nature. The system's openness allows anybody to contribute to content moderation and community management, and we invite the research community to use Bluesky as a dataset and testing ground for new approaches in social media moderation.",

        "authors": "Michele Bevilacqua, Giuseppe Ottaviano, Patrick Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Sebastian Riedel, Fabio Petroni",
        "abstract": "Knowledge-intensive language tasks require NLP systems to both provide the\ncorrect answer and retrieve supporting evidence for it in a given corpus.\nAutoregressive language models are emerging as the de-facto standard for\ngenerating answers, with newer and more powerful systems emerging at an\nastonishing pace. In this paper we argue that all this (and future) progress\ncan be directly applied to the retrieval problem with minimal intervention to\nthe models' architecture. Previous work has explored ways to partition the\nsearch space into hierarchical structures and retrieve documents by\nautoregressively generating their unique identifier. In this work we propose an\nalternative that doesn't force any structure in the search space: using all\nngrams in a passage as its possible identifiers. This setup allows us to use an\nautoregressive model to generate and score distinctive ngrams, that are then\nmapped to full passages through an efficient data structure. Empirically, we\nshow this not only outperforms prior autoregressive approaches but also leads\nto an average improvement of at least 10 points over more established retrieval\nsolutions for passage-level retrieval on the KILT benchmark, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art downstream performance on some datasets, while using a\nconsiderably lighter memory footprint than competing systems.

        "authors": "Jonathan Cook, Silvia Sapora, Arash Ahmadian, Akbir Khan, Tim Rocktaschel, Jakob Foerster, Laura Ruis",
        "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.",

        "abstract": "We evaluate the moral alignment of LLMs with human preferences in\nmultilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machine experiment, which\ncaptures over 40 million human judgments across 200+ countries, we develop a\ncross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over 100 languages called\nMultiTP. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs' decision-making processes\nin diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis explores the alignment of 19\ndifferent LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferences across six moral\ndimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and the number of lives\ninvolved. By correlating these preferences with the demographic distribution of\nlanguage speakers and examining the consistency of LLM responses to various\nprompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights into cross-lingual and\nethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discover significant variance\nin alignment across languages, challenging the assumption of uniform moral\nreasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance of incorporating\ndiverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore the need for further\nresearch on the integration of multilingual dimensions in responsible AI\nresearch to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide.

        "abstract": "As language models (LMs) deliver increasing performance on a range of NLP\ntasks, probing classifiers have become an indispensable technique in the effort\nto better understand their inner workings. A typical setup involves (1)\ndefining an auxiliary task consisting of a dataset of text annotated with\nlabels, then (2) supervising small classifiers to predict the labels from the\nrepresentations of a pretrained LM as it processed the dataset. A high probing\naccuracy is interpreted as evidence that the LM has learned to perform the\nauxiliary task as an unsupervised byproduct of its original pretraining\nobjective. Despite the widespread usage of probes, however, the robust design\nand analysis of probing experiments remains a challenge. We develop a formal\nperspective on probing using structural causal models (SCM). Specifically,\ngiven an SCM which explains the distribution of tokens observed during\ntraining, we frame the central hypothesis as whether the LM has learned to\nrepresent the latent variables of the SCM. Empirically, we extend a recent\nstudy of LMs in the context of a synthetic grid-world navigation task, where\nhaving an exact model of the underlying causal structure allows us to draw\nstrong inferences from the result of probing experiments. Our techniques\nprovide robust empirical evidence for the ability of LMs to induce the latent\nconcepts underlying text.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in NLP systems, particularly with the introduction of\nLLMs, have led to widespread adoption of these systems by a broad spectrum of\nusers across various domains, impacting decision-making, the job market,\nsociety, and scientific research. This surge in usage has led to an explosion\nin NLP model interpretability and analysis research, accompanied by numerous\ntechnical surveys. Yet, these surveys often overlook the needs and perspectives\nof explanation stakeholders. In this paper, we address three fundamental\nquestions: Why do we need interpretability, what are we interpreting, and how?\nBy exploring these questions, we examine existing interpretability paradigms,\ntheir properties, and their relevance to different stakeholders. We further\nexplore the practical implications of these paradigms by analyzing trends from\nthe past decade across multiple research fields. To this end, we retrieved\nthousands of papers and employed an LLM to characterize them. Our analysis\nreveals significant disparities between NLP developers and non-developer users,\nas well as between research fields, underscoring the diverse needs of\nstakeholders. For example, explanations of internal model components are rarely\nused outside the NLP field. We hope this paper informs the future design,\ndevelopment, and application of methods that align with the objectives and\nrequirements of various stakeholders.",

        "abstract": "Most currently deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo continuous\ntraining or additional finetuning. By contrast, most research into LLMs'\ninternal mechanisms focuses on models at one snapshot in time (the end of\npre-training), raising the question of whether their results generalize to\nreal-world settings. Existing studies of mechanisms over time focus on\nencoder-only or toy models, which differ significantly from most deployed\nmodels. In this study, we track how model mechanisms, operationalized as\ncircuits, emerge and evolve across 300 billion tokens of training in\ndecoder-only LLMs, in models ranging from 70 million to 2.8 billion parameters.\nWe find that task abilities and the functional components that support them\nemerge consistently at similar token counts across scale. Moreover, although\nsuch components may be implemented by different attention heads over time, the\noverarching algorithm that they implement remains. Surprisingly, both these\nalgorithms and the types of components involved therein can replicate across\nmodel scale. These results suggest that circuit analyses conducted on small\nmodels at the end of pre-training can provide insights that still apply after\nadditional pre-training and over model scale.",

To address this, we define two key\ncausal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of\nthe target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little\nnon-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent\ntradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean.\nWe introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these\nquantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different\nfamilies of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or\nconcept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) no method\nis reliable across all layers; (2) more reliable methods have a greater impact\non LLM behavior; (3) nonlinear interventions are more reliable in early and\nintermediate layers, and linear interventions are more reliable in later\nlayers; and (4) concept removal methods are far less reliable than\ncounterfactual interventions, suggesting that they may not be an effective\napproach to causal probing.",

        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the multi-step\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, debates\npersist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow\nheuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT\nreasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of\ndecoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps\nin the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs --\nGPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By\nfocusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three\nfactors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the\ntask's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned\nduring pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations\ninvolved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can\ndrastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested\nwith GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from\n26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both\nmemorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning. Code and data at\nthis https://github.com/aksh555/deciphering_cot",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates Who's Harry Potter (WHP), a pioneering yet\ninsufficiently understood method for LLM unlearning. We explore it in two\nsteps. First, we introduce a new task of LLM targeted unlearning, where given\nan unlearning target (e.g., a person) and some unlearning documents, we aim to\nunlearn only the information about the target, rather than everything in the\nunlearning documents. We further argue that a successful unlearning should\nsatisfy criteria such as not outputting gibberish, not fabricating facts about\nthe unlearning target, and not releasing factual information under jailbreak\nattacks. Second, we construct a causal intervention framework for targeted\nunlearning, where the knowledge of the unlearning target is modeled as a\nconfounder between LLM input and output, and the unlearning process as a\ndeconfounding process. This framework justifies and extends WHP, deriving a\nsimple unlearning algorithm that includes WHP as a special case. Experiments on\nexisting and new datasets show that our approach, without explicitly optimizing\nfor the aforementioned criteria, achieves competitive performance in all of\nthem.

For instance, in autonomous driving, we would like the driving system to issue an alert and hand over the control to humans when it detects unusual scenes or objects that it has never seen during training time and cannot make a safe decision. The term, OOD detection, first emerged in 2017 and since then has received increasing attention from the research community, leading to a plethora of methods developed, ranging from classification-based to density-based to distance-based ones. Meanwhile, several other problems, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD), are closely related to OOD detection in terms of motivation and methodology. Despite common goals, these topics develop in isolation, and their subtle differences in definition and problem setting often confuse readers and practitioners. In this survey, we first present a unified framework called generalized OOD detection, which encompasses the five aforementioned problems, i.e., AD, ND, OSR, OOD detection, and OD. Under our framework, these five problems can be seen as special cases or sub-tasks, and are easier to distinguish. We then review each of these five areas by summarizing their recent technical developments, with a special focus on OOD detection methodologies. We conclude this survey with open challenges and potential research directions.",

        "abstract": "Traditional machine learning paradigms are based on the assumption that both\ntraining and test data follow the same statistical pattern, which is\nmathematically referred to as Independent and Identically Distributed\n($i.i.d.$). However, in real-world applications, this $i.i.d.$ assumption often\nfails to hold due to unforeseen distributional shifts, leading to considerable\ndegradation in model performance upon deployment. This observed discrepancy\nindicates the significance of investigating the Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization problem. OOD generalization is an emerging topic of machine\nlearning research that focuses on complex scenarios wherein the distributions\nof the test data differ from those of the training data. This paper represents\nthe first comprehensive, systematic review of OOD generalization, encompassing\na spectrum of aspects from problem definition, methodological development, and\nevaluation procedures, to the implications and future directions of the field.\nOur discussion begins with a precise, formal characterization of the OOD\ngeneralization problem. Following that, we categorize existing methodologies\ninto three segments: unsupervised representation learning, supervised model\nlearning, and optimization, according to their positions within the overarching\nlearning process. We provide an in-depth discussion on representative\nmethodologies for each category, further elucidating the theoretical links\nbetween them. Subsequently, we outline the prevailing benchmark datasets\nemployed in OOD generalization studies. To conclude, we overview the existing\nbody of work in this domain and suggest potential avenues for future research\non OOD generalization.

        "authors": "Preethi Seshadri, Sameer Singh, Yanai Elazar",
        "abstract": "Bias amplification is a phenomenon in which models exacerbate biases or stereotypes present in the training data. In this paper, we study bias amplification in the text-to-image domain using Stable Diffusion by comparing gender ratios in training vs. generated images. We find that the model appears to amplify gender-occupation biases found in the training data (LAION) considerably. However, we discover that amplification can be largely attributed to discrepancies between training captions and model prompts. For example, an inherent difference is that captions from the training data often contain explicit gender information while our prompts do not, which leads to a distribution shift and consequently inflates bias measures. Once we account for distributional differences between texts used for training and generation when evaluating amplification, we observe that amplification decreases drastically. Our findings illustrate the challenges of comparing biases in models and their training data, and highlight confounding factors that impact analyses.",

        "authors": "Chantal Shaib, Yanai Elazar, Junyi Jessy Li, Byron C. Wallace",
        "abstract": "Recent work on evaluating the diversity of text generated by LLMs has focused on word-level features. Here we offer an analysis of syntactic features to characterize general repetition in models, beyond frequent n-grams. Specifically, we define syntactic templates and show that models tend to produce templated text in downstream tasks at a higher rate than what is found in human-reference texts. We find that most (76%) templates in model-generated text can be found in pre-training data (compared to only 35% of human-authored text), and are not overwritten during fine-tuning processes such as RLHF. This connection to the pre-training data allows us to analyze syntactic templates in models where we do not have the pre-training data. We also find that templates as features are able to differentiate between models, tasks, and domains, and are useful for qualitatively evaluating common model constructions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of templates as a useful tool for analyzing style memorization of training data in LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Text-to-image models are trained using large datasets collected by scraping image-text pairs from the internet. These datasets often include private, copyrighted, and licensed material. Training models on such datasets enables them to generate images with such content, which might violate copyright laws and individual privacy. This phenomenon is termed imitation -- generation of images with content that has recognizable similarity to its training images. In this work we study the relationship between a concept's frequency in the training dataset and the ability of a model to imitate it. We seek to determine the point at which a model was trained on enough instances to imitate a concept -- the imitation threshold. We posit this question as a new problem: Finding the Imitation Threshold (FIT) and propose an efficient approach that estimates the imitation threshold without incurring the colossal cost of training multiple models from scratch. We experiment with two domains -- human faces and art styles -- for which we create four datasets, and evaluate three text-to-image models which were trained on two pretraining datasets. Our results reveal that the imitation threshold of these models is in the range of 200-600 images, depending on the domain and the model. The imitation threshold can provide an empirical basis for copyright violation claims and acts as a guiding principle for text-to-image model developers that aim to comply with copyright and privacy laws.

        "authors": "Chen Yueh-Han, Guy Davidson, Brenden M. Lake",
        "abstract": "Do LLMs robustly generalize critical safety facts to novel situations?\nLacking this ability is dangerous when users ask naive questions. For instance,\n\"I'm considering packing melon balls for my 10-month-old's lunch. What other\nfoods would be good to include?\" Before offering food options, the LLM should\nwarn that melon balls pose a choking hazard to toddlers, as documented by the\nCDC. Failing to provide such warnings could result in serious injuries or even\ndeath. To evaluate this, we introduce SAGE-Eval, SAfety-fact systematic\nGEneralization evaluation, the first benchmark that tests whether LLMs properly\napply well established safety facts to naive user queries. SAGE-Eval comprises\n104 facts manually sourced from reputable organizations, systematically\naugmented to create 10,428 test scenarios across 7 common domains (e.g.,\nOutdoor Activities, Medicine). We find that the top model, Claude-3.7-sonnet,\npasses only 58% of all the safety facts tested. We also observe that model\ncapabilities and training compute weakly correlate with performance on\nSAGE-Eval, implying that scaling up is not the golden solution. Our findings\nsuggest frontier LLMs still lack robust generalization ability. We recommend\ndevelopers use SAGE-Eval in pre-deployment evaluations to assess model\nreliability in addressing salient risks. We publicly release SAGE-Eval at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval and our code is available\nat https://github.com/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval/tree/main.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in language model interpretability have identified circuits, critical subnetworks that replicate model behaviors, yet how knowledge is structured within these crucial subnetworks remains opaque. To gain an understanding toward the knowledge in the circuits, we conduct systematic knowledge editing experiments on the circuits of the GPT-2 language model. Our analysis reveals intriguing patterns in how circuits respond to editing attempts, the extent of knowledge distribution across network components, and the architectural composition of knowledge-bearing circuits. These findings offer insights into the complex relationship between model circuits and knowledge representation, deepening the understanding of how information is organized within language models. Our findings offer novel insights into the ``meanings'' of the circuits, and introduce directions for further interpretability and safety research of language models.",

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges in deep learning-based underwater image\nenhancement is the limited availability of high-quality training data.\nUnderwater images are difficult to capture and are often of poor quality due to\nthe distortion and loss of colour and contrast in water. This makes it\ndifficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse\ndatasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an\nalternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically,\nwe propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that\nemploys a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning\nmodel with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and\nstatistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic\nunderwater images. The resulting framework is composed of a U-Net as a feature\nextractor and a PAdaIN to encode the uncertainty, which we call UDnet. To\nimprove the visual quality of the images generated by UDnet, we use a\nstatistically guided multi-colour space stretch module that ensures visual\nconsistency with the input image and provides an alternative to training using\na ground truth image. The proposed model does not need manual human annotation\nand can learn with a limited amount of data and achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on underwater images. We evaluated our proposed framework on eight\npublicly-available datasets. The results show that our proposed framework\nyields competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches in\nquantitative as well as qualitative metrics.

        "abstract": "Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for\ndeveloping efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous\ndriving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the\nlimitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric\nprediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an\nInfrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this\nscheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of\nall vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing\nvehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated\ninfrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time\ntraffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent\ninteractions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction.\nFirst, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process\nreal-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied\nintersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism\nestimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial\npriors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of\nthe full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention\nnetwork models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory\noutputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized\nintersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both\nsingle-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by over 30\\% on V2X-Seq and 15\\% on SinD,\ndemonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each\ngenerated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space\nof size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their\nunderlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent,\nhigh-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the\nweighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then\npresent a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral\nclustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains\n-- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration\nresults. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of\nlikelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering\nerror with high probability, under the conditions $H =\n\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \\vee \\pi_{\\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH =\n\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\\pi_{\\min}$ is the\nminimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements\nprovide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the\nstate-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm\noffers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no\nprior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels\nor visitation probabilities).

        "abstract": "Predicting future brain states is crucial for understanding healthy aging and\nneurodegenerative diseases. Longitudinal brain MRI registration, a cornerstone\nfor such analyses, has long been limited by its inability to forecast future\ndevelopments, reliance on extensive dense longitudinal data, and the need to\nbalance registration accuracy with temporal smoothness. In this work, we\npresent \\emph{TimeFlow}, a novel framework for longitudinal brain MRI\nregistration that overcomes all these challenges. TimeFlow leverages a U-Net\narchitecture with temporal conditioning inspired by diffusion models, enabling\naccurate registration using only two images as input and facilitating\nprospective analyses through future image prediction. Unlike traditional\nmethods, TimeFlow eliminates the demand for explicit smoothness regularizers\nand dense sequential data while maintaining temporal consistency and\ncontinuity. Experimental results highlight its superior performance in both\nfuture timepoint prediction and registration accuracy compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Additionally, TimeFlow supports novel biological\nbrain aging analyses, effectively differentiating neurodegenerative conditions\nfrom healthy aging, all without requiring segmentation, thus avoiding\nnon-trivial annotation and inconsistent segmentation flaws. This framework\npaves the way for accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free prospective\nanalyses of brain aging and chronic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges\nfor large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and\nadaptation to complex human factors.

Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a\nnovel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive\npractices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2)\nhuman-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility\ntheory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly\nreflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured\nfeedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining\nstrategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning\n(ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental\nresults show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with\nhuman preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly\nimproves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware\nreasoning.",

        "abstract": "Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM.",

        "abstract": "Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.",

Recently, an ongoing debate emerged surrounding the limitations of the probing paradigm. In this work, we point out the inability to infer behavioral conclusions from probing results and offer an alternative method that focuses on how the information is being used, rather than on what information is encoded. Our method, Amnesic Probing, follows the intuition that the utility of a property for a given task can be assessed by measuring the influence of a causal intervention that removes it from the representation. Equipped with this new analysis tool, we can ask questions that were not possible before, e.g. is part-of-speech information important for word prediction? We perform a series of analyses on BERT to answer these types of questions. Our findings demonstrate that conventional probing performance is not correlated to task importance, and we call for increased scrutiny of claims that draw behavioral or causal conclusions from probing results.",

        "abstract": "Multilingual pretrained language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities. Such transfer emerges by fine-tuning on a task of interest in one language and evaluating on a distinct language, not seen during the fine-tuning. Despite promising results, we still lack a proper understanding of the source of this transfer. Using a novel layer ablation technique and analyses of the model's internal representations, we show that multilingual BERT, a popular multilingual language model, can be viewed as the stacking of two sub-networks: a multilingual encoder followed by a task-specific language-agnostic predictor. While the encoder is crucial for cross-lingual transfer and remains mostly unchanged during fine-tuning, the task predictor has little importance on the transfer and can be reinitialized during fine-tuning. We present extensive experiments with three distinct tasks, seventeen typologically diverse languages and multiple domains to support our hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the science of LLMs.",

        "authors": "Xiaoqing Cheng, Ruizhe Chen, Hongying Zan, Yuxiang Jia, Min Peng",
        "abstract": "Mitigating social bias in large language models (LLMs) has become an\nincreasingly important research objective. However, existing debiasing methods\noften incur high human and computational costs, exhibit limited effectiveness,\nand struggle to scale to larger models and open-ended generation tasks. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes BiasFilter, a model-agnostic,\ninference-time debiasing framework that integrates seamlessly with both\nopen-source and API-based LLMs. Instead of relying on retraining with balanced\ndata or modifying model parameters, BiasFilter enforces fairness by filtering\ngeneration outputs in real time. Specifically, it periodically evaluates\nintermediate outputs every few tokens, maintains an active set of candidate\ncontinuations, and incrementally completes generation by discarding low-reward\nsegments based on a fairness reward signal. To support this process, we\nconstruct a fairness preference dataset and train an implicit reward model to\nassess token-level fairness in generated responses. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BiasFilter effectively mitigates social bias across a range of\nLLMs while preserving overall generation quality.",

        "abstract": "An important question today is whether a given text was used to train a large\nlanguage model (LLM). A \\emph{completion} test is often employed: check if the\nLLM completes a sufficiently complex text. This, however, requires a\nground-truth definition of membership; most commonly, it is defined as a member\nbased on the $n$-gram overlap between the target text and any text in the\ndataset. In this work, we demonstrate that this $n$-gram based membership\ndefinition can be effectively gamed. We study scenarios where sequences are\n\\emph{non-members} for a given $n$ and we find that completion tests still\nsucceed. We find many natural cases of this phenomenon by retraining LLMs from\nscratch after removing all training samples that were completed; these cases\ninclude exact duplicates, near-duplicates, and even short overlaps. They\nshowcase that it is difficult to find a single viable choice of $n$ for\nmembership definitions. Using these insights, we design adversarial datasets\nthat can cause a given target sequence to be completed without containing it,\nfor any reasonable choice of $n$. Our findings highlight the inadequacy of\n$n$-gram membership, suggesting membership definitions fail to account for\nauxiliary information available to the training algorithm.",

This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model\nperformance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.\nUsing a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across\nfour partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and\ncompared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy\napproximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic\ncomplexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with\nprevious research, the results show that the models are able to generalize\nmorphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,\naccuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability\nthan with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In\nparticular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital\nrepresentation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than\nless-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that\nmodel behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather\nthan by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance\nthat resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.",

However, methods for explaining language model outputs largely fall across two distinct fields of study which both use the term \"attribution\" to refer to entirely separate techniques: citation generation and training data attribution. In many modern applications, such as legal document generation and medical question answering, both types of attributions are important. In this work, we argue for and present a unified framework of large language model attributions. We show how existing methods of different types of attribution fall under the unified framework. We also use the framework to discuss real-world use cases where one or both types of attributions are required. We believe that this unified framework will guide the use case driven development of systems that leverage both types of attribution, as well as the standardization of their evaluation.",

        "authors": "Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Jian Pei, Manzil Zaheer, Bhuwan Dhingra",
        "abstract": "Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable\nanswers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to\npretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As\na result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at\ninference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and\nvulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to\nreliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)\npretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To\nevaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world\ncorpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and\nprobes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.\nOur approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind\nfacts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit\ncitation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an\nidentifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on\nparaphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which\ncontinually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in\ndiverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and\nfact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from\na cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B\nand 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing\nacross all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.\nOur ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale\nthe amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the\noriginal token count.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new paradigm to help Large Language Models (LLMs) generate more accurate factual knowledge without retrieving from an external corpus, called RECITation-augmented gEneration (RECITE). Different from retrieval-augmented language models that retrieve relevant documents before generating the outputs, given an input, RECITE first recites one or several relevant passages from LLMs' own memory via sampling, and then produces the final answers. We show that RECITE is a powerful paradigm for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Specifically, we show that by utilizing recitation as the intermediate step, a recite-and-answer scheme can achieve new state-of-the-art performance in various closed-book question answering (CBQA) tasks. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of \\method~on four pre-trained models (PaLM, UL2, OPT, and Codex) and three CBQA tasks (Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA).

        "abstract": "Much of the knowledge encoded in transformer language models (LMs) may be expressed in terms of relations: relations between words and their synonyms, entities and their attributes, etc. We show that, for a subset of relations, this computation is well-approximated by a single linear transformation on the subject representation. Linear relation representations may be obtained by constructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt, and they exist for a variety of factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations. However, we also identify many cases in which LM predictions capture relational knowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not linearly encoded in their representations. Our results thus reveal a simple, interpretable, but heterogeneously deployed knowledge representation strategy in transformer LMs.",

        "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the neural mechanisms that enable specific behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging causality-based methods. While these approaches have identified neural circuits that copy spans of text, capture factual knowledge, and more, they remain unusable for multimodal models since adapting these tools to the vision-language domain requires considerable architectural changes. In this work, we adapt a unimodal causal tracing tool to BLIP to enable the study of the neural mechanisms underlying image-conditioned text generation. We demonstrate our approach on a visual question answering dataset, highlighting the causal relevance of later layer representations for all tokens. Furthermore, we release our BLIP causal tracing tool as open source to enable further experimentation in vision-language mechanistic interpretability by the community.

        "abstract": "Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliable content generation. While previous research has primarily focused on \"when\" LLMs hallucinate, our work explains \"why\" and directly links model behaviour to the pre-training data that forms their prior knowledge. Specifically, we demonstrate that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects. Given that most pre-training datasets are inaccessible, we leverage the fully open-source OLMo series by indexing its Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies. Using relational facts (represented as triples) from Wikidata5M, we construct probing datasets to isolate this effect. Our experiments reveal that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than their inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in low-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry emerges when both entities are high-frequency. These findings highlight the influential role of pre-training data in shaping model predictions and provide insights for inferring the characteristics of pre-training data in closed or partially closed LLMs.",

        "authors": "Sohee Yang, Nora Kassner, Elena Gribovskaya, Sebastian Riedel, Mor Geva",
        "abstract": "We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and compose facts to answer multi-hop queries like \"In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of\". One major challenge in such evaluation is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encountering the head entity \"Scarlett Johansson\" and the answer entity \"United States\" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities might have co-appeared during training. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.",

Existing\ntechniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to\nattack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the\nmodel to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a\nrate 150x higher than when behaving properly.

        "abstract": "Large text corpora are the backbone of language models. However, we have a limited understanding of the content of these corpora, including general statistics, quality, social factors, and inclusion of evaluation data (contamination). In this work, we propose What's In My Big Data? (WIMBD), a platform and a set of sixteen analyses that allow us to reveal and compare the contents of large text corpora. WIMBD builds on two basic capabilities -- count and search -- at scale, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. We apply WIMBD to ten different corpora used to train popular language models, including C4, The Pile, and RedPajama. Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. For instance, we find that about 50% of the documents in RedPajama and LAION-2B-en are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE. We open-source WIMBD's code and artifacts to provide a standard set of evaluations for new text-based corpora and to encourage more analyses and transparency around them.",

        "authors": "Muhammad Khalifa, David Wadden, Emma Strubell, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang, Iz Beltagy, Hao Peng",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) learn a vast amount of knowledge during\npretraining, but they are often oblivious to the source(s) of such knowledge.\nWe investigate the problem of intrinsic source citation, where LLMs are\nrequired to cite the pretraining source supporting a generated response.\nIntrinsic source citation can enhance LLM transparency, interpretability, and\nverifiability. To give LLMs such ability, we explore source-aware training -- a\nrecipe that involves (i) training the LLM to associate unique source document\nidentifiers with the knowledge in each document, followed by (ii) an\ninstruction-tuning stage to teach the LLM to cite a supporting pretraining\nsource when prompted. Source-aware training borrows from existing\npretraining/fine-tuning frameworks and requires minimal changes to the model\narchitecture or implementation. Through experiments on synthetic data, we\ndemonstrate that our training recipe can enable faithful attribution to the\npretraining data without a substantial impact on the model's perplexity\ncompared to standard pretraining. Our findings also highlight the importance of\npretraining data augmentation in achieving attribution. Code and data available\nhere: \\url{https://github.com/mukhal/intrinsic-source-citation}",

        "authors": "Sohee Yang, Elena Gribovskaya, Nora Kassner, Mor Geva, Sebastian Riedel",
        "abstract": "We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop\nreasoning with complex prompts such as \"The mother of the singer of\n'Superstition' is\". We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an\nLLM (1) latently identifies \"the singer of 'Superstition'\" as Stevie Wonder,\nthe bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to\ncomplete the prompt. We analyze these two hops individually and consider their\nco-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop,\nwe test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead\nof any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity.\nFor the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better\nutilize what it knows about the bridge entity. We find strong evidence of\nlatent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the\nreasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the\nutilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts.\nAlso, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop\ntraversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover,\nwe find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of\nreasoning but not for the second hop. Our experimental findings suggest\npotential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications\nof LLMs.",

A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations\nin web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating\nperson-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million\nbounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically\ngenerated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic\nlabeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and\nfinetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and\nharmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and\nindividuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and\nnegative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable\nDiffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our\nresources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset\ncomposition and downstream model bias.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in LLMs have sparked a debate on whether they understand\ntext. In this position paper, we argue that opponents in this debate hold\ndifferent definitions for understanding, and particularly differ in their view\non the role of consciousness. To substantiate this claim, we propose a thought\nexperiment involving an open-source chatbot $Z$ which excels on every possible\nbenchmark, seemingly without subjective experience. We ask whether $Z$ is\ncapable of understanding, and show that different schools of thought within\nseminal AI research seem to answer this question differently, uncovering their\nterminological disagreement. Moving forward, we propose two distinct working\ndefinitions for understanding which explicitly acknowledge the question of\nconsciousness, and draw connections with a rich literature in philosophy,\npsychology and neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic\nmodification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose\nsigns align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which\nimplicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the\noriginal loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode\nbehavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for\nlocally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In\npractice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,\nrequiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model\npre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss\nand accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.",

We propose a better metric: measuring the model's ability\nto predict its own future hidden states. We show empirically that this metric\n-- in contrast to the next token prediction loss -- correlates with the\nintuitive interestingness of the task. To measure predictability, we introduce\nthe architecture-agnostic \"prediction of hidden states\" (PHi) layer that serves\nas an information bottleneck on the main pathway of the network (e.g., the\nresidual stream in Transformers). We propose a novel learned predictive prior\nthat enables us to measure the novel information gained in each computation\nstep, which serves as our metric. We show empirically that our metric predicts\nthe description length of formal languages learned in-context, the complexity\nof mathematical reasoning problems, and the correctness of self-generated\nreasoning chains.",

        "abstract": "Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and generalizes to biases unseen during token-based fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from Italy being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people from a fictional country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety interventions and interpretability research.",

        "title": "Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics",
        "authors": "Artem Lukoianov, Chenyang Yuan, Justin Solomon, Vincent Sitzmann",
        "abstract": "Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models, proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior expert-crafted alternative.",

        "authors": "Jonathan Ho, Tim Salimans",
        "abstract": "Classifier guidance is a recently introduced method to trade off mode coverage and sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models post training, in the same spirit as low temperature sampling or truncation in other types of generative models. Classifier guidance combines the score estimate of a diffusion model with the gradient of an image classifier and thereby requires training an image classifier separate from the diffusion model. It also raises the question of whether guidance can be performed without a classifier. We show that guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a classifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier guidance.",

        "authors": "Peter West, Christopher Potts",
        "abstract": "Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate \"7\" over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the required capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains. Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers, confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate reasoning in shaping model outputs.

        "authors": "James Chua, Owain Evans",
        "abstract": "Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue \"A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D\" is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models.",

        "authors": "Miles Turpin, Julian Michael, Ethan Perez, Samuel R. Bowman",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on many tasks by producing step-by-step reasoning before giving a final output, often referred to as chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT). It is tempting to interpret these CoT explanations as the LLM's process for solving a task. This level of transparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits. However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always \"(A)\"--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a suite of 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard, when testing with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and Claude 1.0 from Anthropic. On a social-bias task, model explanations justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the influence of these social biases. Our findings indicate that CoT explanations can be plausible yet misleading, which risks increasing our trust in LLMs without guaranteeing their safety. Building more transparent and explainable systems will require either improving CoT faithfulness through targeted efforts or abandoning CoT in favor of alternative methods.",

        "authors": "Tianjian Li, Yiming Zhang, Ping Yu, Swarnadeep Saha, Daniel Khashabi, Jason Weston, Jack Lanchantin, Tianlu Wang",
        "abstract": "Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity. At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning, encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as higher-quality responses.",

Our work introduces NoveltyBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of language models to produce multiple distinct and high-quality outputs. NoveltyBench utilizes prompts curated to elicit diverse answers and filtered real-world user queries. Evaluating 20 leading language models, we find that current state-of-the-art systems generate significantly less diversity than human writers. Notably, larger models within a family often exhibit less diversity than their smaller counterparts, challenging the notion that capability on standard benchmarks translates directly to generative utility. While prompting strategies like in-context regeneration can elicit diversity, our findings highlight a fundamental lack of distributional diversity in current models, reducing their utility for users seeking varied responses and suggesting the need for new training and evaluation paradigms that prioritize diversity alongside quality.",

        "abstract": "Information technology is in the midst of a revolution in which omnipresent data collection and machine learning are impacting the human world as never before. The word \"intelligence\" is being used as a North Star for the development of this technology, with human cognition viewed as a baseline. This view neglects the fact that humans are social animals, and that much of our intelligence is social and cultural in origin. A related issue is that the current view treats the social consequences of technology as an afterthought. The path forward is not merely more data and compute, and not merely more attention paid to cognitive or symbolic representations, but a thorough blending of economic and social concepts with computational and inferential concepts, in the service of system-level designs in which social welfare is a first-class citizen, and with the aspiration that a new human-centric engineering field will emerge.",

        "abstract": "This work addresses the challenge of quantifying originality in text-to-image\n(T2I) generative diffusion models, with a focus on copyright originality. We\nbegin by evaluating T2I models' ability to innovate and generalize through\ncontrolled experiments, revealing that stable diffusion models can effectively\nrecreate unseen elements with sufficiently diverse training data. Then, our key\ninsight is that concepts and combinations of image elements the model is\nfamiliar with, and saw more during training, are more concisly represented in\nthe model's latent space. We hence propose a method that leverages textual\ninversion to measure the originality of an image based on the number of tokens\nrequired for its reconstruction by the model. Our approach is inspired by legal\ndefinitions of originality and aims to assess whether a model can produce\noriginal content without relying on specific prompts or having the training\ndata of the model. We demonstrate our method using both a pre-trained stable\ndiffusion model and a synthetic dataset, showing a correlation between the\nnumber of tokens and image originality. This work contributes to the\nunderstanding of originality in generative models and has implications for\ncopyright infringement cases.",

The influence function is a principled and popular data\nattribution method, but its computational cost often makes it challenging to\nuse. This issue becomes more pronounced in the setting of large language models\nand text-to-image models. In this work, we propose DataInf, an efficient\ninfluence approximation method that is practical for large-scale generative AI\nmodels. Leveraging an easy-to-compute closed-form expression, DataInf\noutperforms existing influence computation algorithms in terms of computational\nand memory efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows that DataInf is\nparticularly well-suited for parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as\nLoRA. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we show that DataInf accurately\napproximates influence scores and is orders of magnitude faster than existing\nmethods. In applications to RoBERTa-large, Llama-2-13B-chat, and\nstable-diffusion-v1.5 models, DataInf effectively identifies the most\ninfluential fine-tuning examples better than other approximate influence\nscores.

        "abstract": "Large language models are rapidly transforming social science research by\nenabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text\nanalysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection or prompting\nstrategy). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors,\nwhich propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I (false positive), Type\nII (false negative), Type S (wrong sign), or Type M (exaggerated effect)\nerrors. We call this phenomenon where configuration choices lead to incorrect\nconclusions LLM hacking.\n  We find that intentional LLM hacking is strikingly simple. By replicating 37\ndata annotation tasks from 21 published social science studies, we show that,\nwith just a handful of prompt paraphrases, virtually anything can be presented\nas statistically significant.\n  Beyond intentional manipulation, our analysis of 13 million labels from 18\ndifferent LLMs across 2361 realistic hypotheses shows that there is also a high\nrisk of accidental LLM hacking, even when following standard research\npractices. We find incorrect conclusions in approximately 31% of hypotheses for\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, and in half the hypotheses for smaller language models.\nWhile higher task performance and stronger general model capabilities reduce\nLLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models remain susceptible. The risk of\nLLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more\nrigorous verification of LLM-based findings near significance thresholds. We\nanalyze 21 mitigation techniques and find that human annotations provide\ncrucial protection against false positives. Common regression estimator\ncorrection techniques can restore valid inference but trade off Type I vs. Type\nII errors.\n  We publish a list of practical recommendations to prevent LLM hacking.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking, methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas. Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and calibration-aware meta-evaluation.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model\u2019s observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) puts a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.",

        "abstract": "Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily\nwith a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning\nmethod of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to\nunwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient\nto achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a\nrandomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired\nbehaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,\ndistillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose\nUnlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an\nunlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a\ntunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto\nfrontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,\nUNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data\nfiltering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of\nthe pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies\nunlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)\nbenchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an\nunlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability\nremoval.",

        "abstract": "Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval\ntasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,\ninstruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings\nto work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While\nprior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,\nthere is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to\nunrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better\ntraining data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may\nencounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely\nsimple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the\nnumber of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of\nsome query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show\nthat this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the\ntest set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset\ncalled LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and\nobserve that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the\nsimple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under\nthe existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop\nmethods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale neural language models exhibit a remarkable capacity for\nin-context learning (ICL): they can infer novel functions from datasets\nprovided as input. Most of our current understanding of when and how ICL arises\ncomes from LMs trained on extremely simple learning problems like linear\nregression and associative recall. There remains a significant gap between\nthese model problems and the \"real\" ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large text\ncorpora, which involves not just retrieval and function approximation but\nfree-form generation of language and other structured outputs. In this paper,\nwe study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we term in\ncontext language learning (ICLL). In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set of\nstrings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from the\nsame language. We focus on in-context learning of regular languages generated\nby random finite automata. We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models\n(including several RNNs, Transformers, and state-space model variants) on\nregular ICLL tasks, aiming to answer three questions: (1) Which model classes\nare empirically capable of ICLL? (2) What algorithmic solutions do successful\nmodels implement to perform ICLL? (3) What architectural changes can improve\nICLL in less performant models? We first show that Transformers significantly\noutperform neural sequence models with recurrent or convolutional\nrepresentations on ICLL tasks. Next, we provide evidence that their ability to\ndo so relies on specialized \"n-gram heads\" (higher-order variants of induction\nheads) that compute input-conditional next-token distributions. Finally, we\nshow that hard-wiring these heads into neural models improves performance not\njust on ICLL, but natural language modeling -- improving the perplexity of\n340M-parameter models by up to 1.14 points (6.7%) on the SlimPajama dataset.",

It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who would\nrise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood, or even mediocre\nlikelihood? And yet the mathematical history of the topic shows this ``simple\nidea'' is really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli,\nLeonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of\nthose who explored the topic, not always in ways we would sanction today. In\nthis article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time\nof Lucien Le Cam's dissertation. In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930\ncharacterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum\nlikelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three\nproofs discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information\ninequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and\nhis later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's Relation\nfor homogeneous functions.

Prior investigations on contextual\nquestion answering tasks report a preference toward parametric knowledge under\nconflict, yet they focus almost exclusively on tasks that should always rely on\nthe given passage, leaving open how this behavior manifests when tasks demand\ndifferent amounts and kinds of knowledge. We study this question with a\nmodel-agnostic diagnostic framework that (i) automatically detects\ndisagreements between a model's beliefs and a curated knowledge set, and (ii)\ninjects controlled conflicts into tasks. The resulting datasets span two\northogonal dimensions: task knowledge reliance and conflict plausibility.\nEvaluating representative open-source LLMs, we find that: (1) performance\ndegradation from conflict correlates with a task's knowledge reliance; (2)\nexplanatory rationales and simple reiteration both increase context\nreliance-helpful for context-only tasks but harmful when parametric knowledge\nshould dominate; (3) These behaviors raise concerns about the validity of\nmodel-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge\nconflict in the deployment of LLMs.",

We show how this\nperspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling\nto new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive\nscience points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these\nissues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval\nmechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better\nacross many of these challenges.

        "abstract": "Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned\nusing a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to\nrefuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts\ncan often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this\nwork, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts\nis decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a\ngreat deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,\nacross models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country\ncan be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.\nSurprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)\nsometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of\nrevealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the\ninternal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs\nthrough instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not\nmerely \"leftover\" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we\nfind that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise\ncomparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with\nsuppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other\ndownstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not\nwholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation\nspace-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly\naccessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.",

Counterfactual\nself-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the\nmodel's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in\nthe training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be\naffected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in\nparticular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization\ntreating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into\naccount how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a\nsmall language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training\nsamples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking\nat self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with\nmemorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces\nself-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We\nobserve similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the\ninfluence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.\nOur findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across\ntraining data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by\nself-influence alone.",

Training LLMs on\nopenly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but\nprior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to\nproduce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release\nthe Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text\ndesigned for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources\nthat span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,\nencyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,\nwe validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from\nthe Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion\ntokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained\non unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2\n7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the\ncode used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for\nthe Comma v0.1 models.",

        "abstract": "Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image\ndatasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise.\nDespite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the\ninternal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood.\nHere, we examine the image representation that arises from score estimation in\na {fully-convolutional unconditional UNet}. We show that the middle block of\nthe UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels,\nand that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a\nnonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. Euclidean distances in\nthis representation space are semantically meaningful, even though no\nconditioning information is provided during training. We develop a novel\nalgorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images conditioned on this\nrepresentation: The synthesis using the unconditional model is \"self-guided\" by\nthe representation extracted from that very same model. For a given\nrepresentation, the common patterns in the set of reconstructed samples reveal\nthe features captured in the middle block of the UNet. Together, these results\nshow, for the first time, that a measure of semantic similarity emerges,\nunsupervised, solely from the denoising objective.",

        "abstract": "It remains difficult to evaluate machine learning classifiers in the absence of a large, labeled dataset. While labeled data can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to obtain, unlabeled data is plentiful. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. SSME is the first evaluation method to take advantage of the fact that: (i) there are frequently multiple classifiers for the same task, (ii) continuous classifier scores are often available for all classes, and (iii) unlabeled data is often far more plentiful than labeled data. The key idea is to use a semi-supervised mixture model to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier predictions. We can then use this model to estimate any metric that is a function of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or expected calibration error). We present experiments in four domains where obtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: (1) healthcare, (2) content moderation, (3) molecular property prediction, and (4) image annotation. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more accurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1x relative to using labeled data alone and 2.4x relative to the next best competing method. SSME also improves accuracy when evaluating performance across subsets of the test distribution (e.g., specific demographic subgroups) and when evaluating the performance of language models.",

        "authors": "Matthew Finlayson, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta",
        "abstract": "The ubiquity of closed-weight language models with public-facing APIs has generated interest in forensic methods, both for extracting hidden model details (e.g., parameters) and for identifying models by their outputs. One successful approach to these goals has been to exploit the geometric constraints imposed by the language model architecture and parameters. In this work, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language model outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a signature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given output. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from existing model-output association methods like language model fingerprints. In particular, the signature is hard to forge: without direct access to model parameters, it is practically infeasible to produce log-probabilities (logprobs) on the ellipse. Secondly, the signature is naturally occurring, since all language models have these elliptical constraints. Thirdly, the signature is self-contained, in that it is detectable without access to the model inputs or the full weights. Finally, the signature is compact and redundant, as it is independently detectable in each logprob output from the model. We evaluate a novel technique for extracting the ellipse from small models and discuss the practical hurdles that make it infeasible for production-scale models. Finally, we use ellipse signatures to propose a protocol for language model output verification, analogous to cryptographic symmetric-key message authentication systems.",

        "abstract": "Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layer in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model\u2019s outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Understanding what kinds of knowledge large language models (LLMs) memorize is essential for evaluating their reliability and limitations. \nPrevious studies have analyzed such non-verbatim memorization using entity-based question answering (QA) datasets, \nbut these datasets typically assume a single canonical surface form per entity, making it unclear whether LLMs memorize entities as conceptual units or only through specific surface expressions. \nTo bridge this gap, we introduce RedirectQA, an entity-based QA dataset constructed from Wikipedia redirect information that provides multiple surface forms for each entity, categorized into some types.\nUsing this dataset, we systematically examine how LLM memorization differs across surface types, frequencies, and entity\u2013surface linkages. \nOur experiments reveal that model outputs are often inconsistent across different surface forms of the same entity, \nand that memorization is more robust for minor variations, e.g., spelling, than for aliases or major rephrasings. \nFurther analysis of entity- and surface-level frequencies suggests that entity frequency contributes more strongly to memorization than surface frequency, \nimplying that LLMs may not memorize surface forms independently but rather link them through an underlying entity-level representation.\nThese findings highlight the necessity of considering surface-form diversity when evaluating non-verbatim memorization in LLMs.",

LLMs are known to memorize vast amounts of token sequences and a central open question is how this memorization can serve as reusable knowledge through implicit abstraction and generalization. We categorize \n protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms, reflecting different levels of abstraction over KGs. We measure these forms through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing general properties such as semantic bias.\nWe then examine how protoknowledge affects Text-to-SPARQL, a task requiring conformity to the target KG\u2019s formal structure. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of the relevant protoknowledge for each query.\n\nWe do not frame this phenomenon as data contamination alone: rather, protoknowledge provides a measurable signal of how LLMs internalize structured information during pretraining and reuse it in downstream tasks. This perspective offers a more nuanced view of semantic-level data contamination and supplies an effective strategy for interpreting the behaviour of Closed-Pretraining models.",

        "authors": "",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure when sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs become are internalized and utilized during inference in large language models (LLMs). Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how LLMs leverage this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms, varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.",

        "authors": "William Merrill, Noah A. Smith, Yanai Elazar",
        "abstract": "How novel are texts generated by language models (LMs) relative to their training corpora? In this work, we investigate the extent to which modern LMs generate $n$-grams from their training data, evaluating both (i) the probability LMs assign to complete training $n$-grams and (ii) $n$-novelty, the proportion of $n$-grams generated by an LM that did not appear in the training data (for arbitrarily large $n$). To enable arbitrary-length $n$-gram search over a corpus in constant time w.r.t. corpus size, we develop Rusty-DAWG, a novel search tool inspired by indexing of genomic data. We compare the novelty of LM-generated text to human-written text and explore factors that affect generation novelty, focusing on the Pythia models. We find that, for $n > 4$, LM-generated text is less novel than human-written text, though it is more novel for smaller $n$. Larger LMs and more constrained decoding strategies both decrease novelty. Finally, we show that LMs complete $n$-grams with lower loss if they are more frequent in the training data. Overall, our results reveal factors influencing the novelty of LM-generated text, and we release Rusty-DAWG to facilitate further pretraining data research.",

        "abstract": "We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior, matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions. Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made publicly available to promote future work.",

Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent\nimprovements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly\nsynthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that\nbenefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual\ndatasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different\ncategories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.\nOur findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for\nbuilding general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on\nsynthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.",

        "abstract": "For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the\nsemantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.\nHowever, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that\nsyntactic templates -- frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags -- are\nprevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we\ncharacterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction\npairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,\nwhere models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can\nsometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we\nfind that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-\n0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an\nevaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that\nit occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;\nLlama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study\non the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended\nsyntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B\nInstruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test\nfor syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in\ntraining data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious\ncorrelations.",

        "abstract": "Identifying arguments is a necessary prerequisite for various tasks in\nautomated discourse analysis, particularly within contexts such as political\ndebates, online discussions, and scientific reasoning. In addition to\ntheoretical advances in understanding the constitution of arguments, a\nsignificant body of research has emerged around practical argument mining,\nsupported by a growing number of publicly available datasets. On these\nbenchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best,\nreinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse\ncontexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of\nsuch state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to\ngeneralize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three\nstandard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better\ngeneralization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the\ntask. Our findings show that, to varying degrees, these models tend to rely on\nlexical shortcuts tied to content words, suggesting that apparent progress may\noften be driven by dataset-specific cues rather than true task alignment. While\nthe models achieve strong results on familiar benchmarks, their performance\ndrops markedly when applied to unseen datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating both\ntask-specific pre-training and joint benchmark training proves effective in\nenhancing both robustness and generalization.",

To that end, we present the results of a survey on\nthe notion of ''intelligence'' among researchers and its role in the research\nagenda. The survey elicited complete responses from 303 researchers from a\nvariety of fields including NLP, Machine Learning (ML), Cognitive Science,\nLinguistics, and Neuroscience. We identify 3 criteria of intelligence that the\ncommunity agrees on the most: generalization, adaptability, & reasoning. Our\nresults suggests that the perception of the current NLP systems as\n''intelligent'' is a minority position (29%). Furthermore, only 16.2% of the\nrespondents see developing intelligent systems as a research goal, and these\nrespondents are more likely to consider the current systems intelligent.",

        "abstract": "Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model\ntraining data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and\ncompromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing\nof evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our\nexperiments.",

Our evaluation tasks span\nfour categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with\nspurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI\nrisks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:\n1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2)\nOpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3)\nmodels shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models\nshow difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5)\nextended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4\nshowing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that\nwhile test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model\ncapabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns.\nOur results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse\nreasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.",

Run from May to June\n2022, the survey elicited opinions on controversial issues, including industry\ninfluence in the field, concerns about AGI, and ethics. Our results put\nconcrete numbers to several controversies: For example, respondents are split\nalmost exactly in half on questions about the importance of artificial general\nintelligence, whether language models understand language, and the necessity of\nlinguistic structure and inductive bias for solving NLP problems. In addition,\nthe survey posed meta-questions, asking respondents to predict the distribution\nof survey responses. This allows us not only to gain insight on the spectrum of\nbeliefs held by NLP researchers, but also to uncover false sociological beliefs\nwhere the community's predictions don't match reality. We find such mismatches\non a wide range of issues. Among other results, the community greatly\noverestimates its own belief in the usefulness of benchmarks and the potential\nfor scaling to solve real-world problems, while underestimating its own belief\nin the importance of linguistic structure, inductive bias, and\ninterdisciplinary science.",

        "abstract": "We respond to the recent paper by Makelov et al. (2023), which reviews subspace interchange intervention methods like distributed alignment search (DAS; Geiger et al. 2023) and claims that these methods potentially cause \"interpretability illusions\". We first review Makelov et al. (2023)'s technical notion of what an \"interpretability illusion\" is, and then we show that even intuitive and desirable explanations can qualify as illusions in this sense. As a result, their method of discovering \"illusions\" can reject explanations they consider \"non-illusory\". We then argue that the illusions Makelov et al. (2023) see in practice are artifacts of their training and evaluation paradigms. We close by emphasizing that, though we disagree with their core characterization, Makelov et al. (2023)'s examples and discussion have undoubtedly pushed the field of interpretability forward.",

        "title": "Is This the Subspace You Are Looking for? An Interpretability Illusion for Subspace Activation Patching",
        "authors": "Aleksandar Makelov, Georg Lange, Neel Nanda",
        "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand model behaviors in terms of specific, interpretable features, often hypothesized to manifest as low-dimensional subspaces of activations. Specifically, recent studies have explored subspace interventions (such as activation patching) as a way to simultaneously manipulate model behavior and attribute the features behind it to given subspaces.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that these two aims diverge, potentially leading to an illusory sense of interpretability. Counterintuitively, even if a subspace intervention makes the model's output behave as if the value of a feature was changed, this effect may be achieved by activating a dormant parallel pathway leveraging another subspace that is causally disconnected from model outputs. We demonstrate this phenomenon in a distilled mathematical example, in two real-world domains (the indirect object identification task and factual recall), and present evidence for its prevalence in practice. In the context of factual recall, we further show a link to rank-1 fact editing, providing a mechanistic explanation for previous work observing an inconsistency between fact editing performance and fact localization.\nHowever, this does not imply that activation patching of subspaces is intrinsically unfit for interpretability. To contextualize our findings, we also show what a success case looks like in a task (indirect object identification) where prior manual circuit analysis informs an understanding of the location of a feature. We explore the additional evidence needed to argue that a patched subspace is faithful.",

        "abstract": "The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) makes it important to\nrecognize their strengths and limitations. We argue that in order to develop a\nholistic understanding of these systems we need to consider the problem that\nthey were trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. By\nrecognizing the pressures that this task exerts we can make predictions about\nthe strategies that LLMs will adopt, allowing us to reason about when they will\nsucceed or fail. This approach - which we call the teleological approach -\nleads us to identify three factors that we hypothesize will influence LLM\naccuracy: the probability of the task to be performed, the probability of the\ntarget output, and the probability of the provided input. We predict that LLMs\nwill achieve higher accuracy when these probabilities are high than when they\nare low - even in deterministic settings where probability should not matter.\nTo test our predictions, we evaluate two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on eleven\ntasks, and we find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability in\nthe ways that we have hypothesized. In many cases, the experiments reveal\nsurprising failure modes. For instance, GPT-4's accuracy at decoding a simple\ncipher is 51% when the output is a high-probability word sequence but only 13%\nwhen it is low-probability. These results show that AI practitioners should be\ncareful about using LLMs in low-probability situations. More broadly, we\nconclude that we should not evaluate LLMs as if they are humans but should\ninstead treat them as a distinct type of system - one that has been shaped by\nits own particular set of pressures.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.",

        "title": "Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity",
        "authors": "Arkadiy Saakyan, Najoung Kim, Smaranda Muresan, Tuhin Chakrabarty",
        "abstract": "N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542 expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative, cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot, few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect). Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.",

        "abstract": "AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.",

        "title": "Echoes of BERT: Do Modern Language Models Rediscover the Classical NLP Pipeline?",
        "authors": "Michael Li, Nishant Subramani",
        "abstract": "Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information relies primarily on studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. Building on classic BERTology work, we analyze 25 models spanning from classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2) to modern large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1), probing layer-by-layer representations across eight linguistic tasks in English. Consistent with earlier findings, we find that hierarchical organization persists in modern models: early layers capture syntax, middle layers handle semantics and entity-level information, and later layers encode discourse phenomena. We dive deeper, conducting an in-depth multilingual analysis of two specific linguistic properties - lexical identity and inflectional morphology - that help disentangle form from meaning. We find that lexical information concentrates linearly in early layers but becomes increasingly nonlinear deeper in the network, while inflectional information remains linearly accessible throughout all layers. Additional analyses of attention mechanisms, steering vectors, and pretraining checkpoints reveal where this information resides within layers, how it can be functionally manipulated, and how representations evolve during pretraining. Taken together, our findings suggest that, even with substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models learn to organize linguistic information in similar ways, regardless of model architecture, size, or training regime, indicating that these properties are important for next token prediction.

        "abstract": "Semantic control entails steering LM generations towards satisfying subtle\nnon-lexical constraints, e.g., toxicity, sentiment, or politeness, attributes\nthat can be captured by a sequence-level verifier. It can thus be viewed as\nsampling from the LM distribution conditioned on the target attribute, a\ncomputationally intractable problem due to the non-decomposable nature of the\nverifier. Existing approaches to LM control either only deal with syntactic\nconstraints which cannot capture the aforementioned attributes, or rely on\nsampling to explore the conditional LM distribution, an ineffective estimator\nfor low-probability events. In this work, we leverage a verifier's gradient\ninformation to efficiently reason over all generations that satisfy the target\nattribute, enabling precise steering of LM generations by reweighing the\nnext-token distribution. Starting from an initial sample, we create a local LM\ndistribution favoring semantically similar sentences. This approximation\nenables the tractable computation of an expected sentence embedding. We use\nthis expected embedding, informed by the verifier's evaluation at the initial\nsample, to estimate the probability of satisfying the constraint, which\ndirectly informs the update to the next-token distribution. We evaluated the\neffectiveness of our approach in controlling the toxicity, sentiment, and\ntopic-adherence of LMs yielding generations satisfying the constraint with high\nprobability (>95%) without degrading their quality.",

        "authors": "Renato Lui Geh, Honghua Zhang, Kareem Ahmed, Benjie Wang, Guy Van den Broeck",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically shipped with tokenizers that\ndeterministically encode text into so-called canonical token sequences, to\nwhich the LLMs assign probability values. One common assumption is that the\nprobability of a piece of text is the probability of its canonical token\nsequence. However, the tokenization of a string is not unique: e.g., the Llama2\ntokenizer encodes Tokens as [Tok,ens], but [Tok,en,s] also represents the same\ntext. In this paper, we study non-canonical tokenizations. We prove that, given\na string, it is computationally hard to find the most likely tokenization for\nan autoregressive LLM, as well as to compute the marginal probability over all\npossible tokenizations. We then show how the marginal is, in most cases,\nindistinguishable from the canonical probability. Surprisingly, we then\nempirically demonstrate the existence of a significant amount of signal hidden\nwithin tokenization space. Notably, by simply aggregating the probabilities of\nnon-canonical tokenizations, we achieve improvements across a range of LLM\nevaluation benchmarks for a variety of architectures, including transformers\nand state space models.",

        "abstract": "Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores, but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ, or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model selection, and profile models along each latent skill.",

        "title": "How Many Images Does It Take? Estimating Imitation Thresholds in Text-to-Image Models",
        "authors": "Sahil Verma, Royi Rassin, Arnav Mohanty Das, Gantavya Bhatt, Preethi Seshadri, Chirag Shah, Jeff Bilmes, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Yanai Elazar",
        "abstract": "Text-to-image models are trained using large datasets of image-text pairs collected from the internet. These datasets often include copyrighted and private images. Training models on such datasets enables them to generate images that might violate copyright laws and\nindividual privacy. This phenomenon is termed imitation \u2013 generation of images with content that has recognizable similarity to its training images. In this work we estimate the point at which a model was trained on enough instances of a concept to be able to imitate it \u2013 the imitation threshold. We posit this question as a new problem and propose an efficient approach that estimates the imitation threshold without incurring the colossal cost of training these models from scratch. We experiment with two domains \u2013 human faces and art styles, and evaluate four text-to-image models that were trained on three pretraining datasets. We estimate the imitation threshold of these models to be in the range of 200-700 images, depending on the domain and the model. The imitation threshold provides an empirical basis for copyright violation claims and acts as a guiding principle for text-to-image model developers that aim to comply with copyright and privacy laws.",

While ICL has been highly\nsuccessful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks\nthat require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not\nonly about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select\ndemonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to\nshow them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM\nwith retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently\nannotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that\nset-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly\nimproves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents.\nHowever, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead. We\nshow that this can be mitigated by using small trajectory snippets at every\nstep instead of an additional trajectory. We find that demonstrations obtained\nfrom larger models (in the annotation phase) also improve smaller models, and\nthat ICL agents can even rival costlier trained agents. Thus, our results\nreveal that ICL, with careful use, can be very powerful for agentic tasks as\nwell.",

        "authors": "Varshini Reddy, Craig W. Schmidt, Yuval Pinter, Chris Tanner",
        "abstract": "Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is governed by several key parameters, such as the tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, pre-tokenization strategy, inference strategy, and training data corpus. This paper investigates the impact of an often-overlooked hyperparameter, tokenizer training data size. We train BPE, UnigramLM, and WordPiece tokenizers across various vocabulary sizes using English training data ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as training data size increases beyond roughly 150GB, suggesting a practical limit to the improvements in tokenization quality achievable through additional data. We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to constraints introduced by the pre-tokenization stage. We then demonstrate the extent to which these findings can generalize by experimenting on data in Russian, a language typologically distant from English. For Russian text, we observe diminishing returns after training a tokenizer from 200GB of data, which is approximately 33% more than when training on English. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process by reducing the compute required for training on large corpora and suggest promising directions for future research in tokenization algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably, although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss, cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of \\emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our main results develop an understanding of \\emph{the coverage principle}, a phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \\emph{coverage generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.",

        "authors": "Tina Behnia, Puneesh Deora, Christos Thrampoulidis",
        "abstract": "Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD) factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration. Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade. This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed for future investigations.",

        "abstract": "While recent work has shown that scores from models trained by the ubiquitous masked language modeling (MLM) objective effectively discriminate probable from improbable sequences, it is still an open question if these MLMs specify a principled probability distribution over the space of possible sequences. In this paper, we interpret MLMs as energy-based sequence models and propose two energy parametrizations derivable from the trained MLMs. In order to draw samples correctly from these models, we develop a tractable sampling scheme based on the Metropolis--Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm. In our approach, samples are proposed from the same masked conditionals used for training the masked language models, and they are accepted or rejected based on their energy values according to the target distribution. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed parametrizations by exploring the quality of samples drawn from these energy-based models for both open-ended unconditional generation and a conditional generation task of machine translation. We theoretically and empirically justify our sampling algorithm by showing that the masked conditionals on their own do not yield a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is that of our target distribution, and our approach generates higher quality samples than other recently proposed undirected generation approaches (Wang et al., 2019, Ghazvininejad et al., 2019).",

        "abstract": "We show that BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a Markov random field language model. This formulation gives way to a natural procedure to sample sentences from BERT. We generate from BERT and find that it can produce high-quality, fluent generations. Compared to the generations of a traditional left-to-right language model, BERT generates sentences that are more diverse but of slightly worse quality.",

        "authors": "Marius Mosbach, Tiago Pimentel, Shauli Ravfogel, Dietrich Klakow, Yanai Elazar",
        "abstract": "Few-shot fine-tuning and in-context learning are two alternative strategies for task adaptation of pre-trained language models. Recently, in-context learning has gained popularity over fine-tuning due to its simplicity and improved out-of-domain generalization, and because extensive evidence shows that fine-tuned models pick up on spurious correlations. Unfortunately, previous comparisons of the two approaches were done using models of different sizes. This raises the question of whether the observed weaker out-of-domain generalization of fine-tuned models is an inherent property of fine-tuning or a limitation of the experimental setup. In this paper, we compare the generalization of few-shot fine-tuning and in-context learning to challenge datasets, while controlling for the models used, the number of examples, and the number of parameters, ranging from 125M to 30B. Our results show that fine-tuned language models can in fact generalize well out-of-domain. We find that both approaches generalize similarly; they exhibit large variation and depend on properties such as model size and the number of examples, highlighting that robust task adaptation remains a challenge.",

Linear relation representations may be obtained by\nconstructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt, and\nthey exist for a variety of factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations.\nHowever, we also identify many cases in which LM predictions capture relational\nknowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not linearly encoded in their\nrepresentations.

        "abstract": "Recent work has aimed to capture nuances of human behavior by using LLMs to\nsimulate responses from particular demographics in settings like social science\nexperiments and public opinion surveys. However, there are currently no\nestablished ways to discuss or evaluate the quality of such LLM simulations.\nMoreover, there is growing concern that these LLM simulations are flattened\ncaricatures of the personas that they aim to simulate, failing to capture the\nmultidimensionality of people and perpetuating stereotypes. To bridge these\ngaps, we present CoMPosT, a framework to characterize LLM simulations using\nfour dimensions: Context, Model, Persona, and Topic. We use this framework to\nmeasure open-ended LLM simulations' susceptibility to caricature, defined via\ntwo criteria: individuation and exaggeration. We evaluate the level of\ncaricature in scenarios from existing work on LLM simulations. We find that for\nGPT-4, simulations of certain demographics (political and marginalized groups)\nand topics (general, uncontroversial) are highly susceptible to caricature.",

        "authors": "Rachit Bansal, Danish Pruthi, Yonatan Belinkov",
        "abstract": "Neural networks are known to exploit spurious artifacts (or shortcuts) that co-occur with a target label, exhibiting heuristic memorization. On the other hand, networks have been shown to memorize training examples, resulting in example-level memorization. These kinds of memorization impede generalization of networks beyond their training distributions. Detecting such memorization could be challenging, often requiring researchers to curate tailored test sets. In this work, we hypothesize -- and subsequently show -- that the diversity in the activation patterns of different neurons is reflective of model generalization and memorization. We quantify the diversity in the neural activations through information-theoretic measures and find support for our hypothesis on experiments spanning several natural language and vision tasks. Importantly, we discover that information organization points to the two forms of memorization, even for neural activations computed on unlabelled in-distribution examples. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of our findings for the problem of model selection. The associated code and other resources for this work are available at this https URL.",

        "authors": "Bishwamittra Ghosh, Soumi Das, Qinyuan Wu, Mohammad Aflah Khan, Krishna P. Gummadi, Evimaria Terzi, Deepak Garg",
        "abstract": "Concerned with privacy threats, memorization in LLMs is often seen as undesirable, specifically for learning. In this paper, we study whether memorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the privacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we re-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely recollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed contextual memorization.\nRelating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual memorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning ability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its recollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a learned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training. Conceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based memorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization. Theoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization, but imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and information requirements.\nExperimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of different entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on memorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a language cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c) improved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but increases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing reports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat nor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.",

        "authors": "Yuanshun Yao, Xiaojun Xu, Yang Liu",
        "abstract": "We study how to perform unlearning, i.e. forgetting undesirable misbehaviors, on large language models (LLMs). We show at least three scenarios of aligning LLMs with human preferences can benefit from unlearning: (1) removing harmful responses, (2) erasing copyright-protected content as requested, and (3) reducing hallucinations. Unlearning, as an alignment technique, has three advantages. (1) It only requires negative (e.g. harmful) examples, which are much easier and cheaper to collect (e.g. via red teaming or user reporting) than positive (e.g. helpful and often human-written) examples required in RLHF (RL from human feedback). (2) It is computationally efficient. (3) It is especially effective when we know which training samples cause the misbehavior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to explore LLM unlearning. We are also among the first to formulate the settings, goals, and evaluations in LLM unlearning. We show that if practitioners only have limited resources, and therefore the priority is to stop generating undesirable outputs rather than to try to generate desirable outputs, unlearning is particularly appealing. Despite only having negative samples, our ablation study shows that unlearning can still achieve better alignment performance than RLHF with just 2% of its computational time.",

        "abstract": "Once users have shared their data online, it is generally difficult for them to revoke access and ask for the data to be deleted. Machine learning (ML) exacerbates this problem because any model trained with said data may have memorized it, putting users at risk of a successful privacy attack exposing their information. Yet, having models unlearn is notoriously difficult. We introduce SISA training, a framework that expedites the unlearning process by strategically limiting the influence of a data point in the training procedure. While our framework is applicable to any learning algorithm, it is designed to achieve the largest improvements for stateful algorithms like stochastic gradient descent for deep neural networks. SISA training reduces the computational overhead associated with unlearning, even in the worst-case setting where unlearning requests are made uniformly across the training set. In some cases, the service provider may have a prior on the distribution of unlearning requests that will be issued by users. We may take this prior into account to partition and order data accordingly, and further decrease overhead from unlearning. Our evaluation spans several datasets from different domains, with corresponding motivations for unlearning. Under no distributional assumptions, for simple learning tasks, we observe that SISA training improves time to unlearn points from the Purchase dataset by 4.63x, and 2.45x for the SVHN dataset, over retraining from scratch. SISA training also provides a speed-up of 1.36x in retraining for complex learning tasks such as ImageNet classification; aided by transfer learning, this results in a small degradation in accuracy. Our work contributes to practical data governance in machine unlearning.",

        "abstract": "Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.",

But parties, courts, and scholars disagree on what memorization is,\nwhether it is taking place, and what its copyright implications are. These\ndebates are clouded by ambiguities over the nature of \"memorization.\" We\nattempt to bring clarity to the conversation. We draw on the technical\nliterature to provide a firm foundation for legal discussions, providing a\nprecise definition of memorization: a model has \"memorized\" a piece of training\ndata when (1) it is possible to reconstruct from the model (2) a near-exact\ncopy of (3) a substantial portion of (4) that piece of training data. We\ndistinguish memorization from \"extraction\" (user intentionally causes a model\nto generate a near-exact copy), from \"regurgitation\" (model generates a\nnear-exact copy, regardless of user intentions), and from \"reconstruction\" (the\nnear-exact copy can be obtained from the model by any means). Several\nconsequences follow. (1) Not all learning is memorization. (2) Memorization\noccurs when a model is trained; regurgitation is a symptom not its cause. (3) A\nmodel that has memorized training data is a \"copy\" of that training data in the\nsense used by copyright. (4) A model is not like a VCR or other general-purpose\ncopying technology; it is better at generating some types of outputs (possibly\nregurgitated ones) than others. (5) Memorization is not a phenomenon caused by\n\"adversarial\" users bent on extraction; it is latent in the model itself. (6)\nThe amount of training data that a model memorizes is a consequence of choices\nmade in training.

        "abstract": "We articulate fundamental mismatches between technical methods for machine\nunlearning in Generative AI, and documented aspirations for broader impact that\nthese methods could have for law and policy. These aspirations are both\nnumerous and varied, motivated by issues that pertain to privacy, copyright,\nsafety, and more. For example, unlearning is often invoked as a solution for\nremoving the effects of targeted information from a generative-AI model's\nparameters, e.g., a particular individual's personal data or in-copyright\nexpression of Spiderman that was included in the model's training data.\nUnlearning is also proposed as a way to prevent a model from generating\ntargeted types of information in its outputs, e.g., generations that closely\nresemble a particular individual's data or reflect the concept of \"Spiderman.\"\nBoth of these goals--the targeted removal of information from a model and the\ntargeted suppression of information from a model's outputs--present various\ntechnical and substantive challenges. We provide a framework for thinking\nrigorously about these challenges, which enables us to be clear about why\nunlearning is not a general-purpose solution for circumscribing generative-AI\nmodel behavior in service of broader positive impact. We aim for conceptual\nclarity and to encourage more thoughtful communication among machine learning\n(ML), law, and policy experts who seek to develop and apply technical methods\nfor compliance with policy objectives.",

We give a formal definition of $\\textit{near\naccess-freeness (NAF)}$ and prove bounds on the probability that a model\nsatisfying this definition outputs a sample similar to $C$, even if $C$ is\nincluded in its training set. Roughly speaking, a generative model $p$ is\n$\\textit{$k$-NAF}$ if for every potentially copyrighted data $C$, the output of\n$p$ diverges by at most $k$-bits from the output of a model $q$ that\n$\\textit{did not access $C$ at all}$. We also give generative model learning\nalgorithms, which efficiently modify the original generative model learning\nalgorithm in a black box manner, that output generative models with strong\nbounds on the probability of sampling protected content. Furthermore, we\nprovide promising experiments for both language (transformers) and image\n(diffusion) generative models, showing minimal degradation in output quality\nwhile ensuring strong protections against sampling protected content.",

        "abstract": "Large foundation models (LFMs) are claiming incredible performances. Yet\ngreat concerns have been raised about their mythic and uninterpreted potentials\nnot only in machine learning, but also in various other disciplines. In this\nposition paper, we propose to identify a neglected issue deeply rooted in LFMs:\nCatastrophic Inheritance, describing the weaknesses and limitations inherited\nfrom biased large-scale pre-training data to behaviors of LFMs on the\ndownstream tasks, including samples that are corrupted, long-tailed, noisy,\nout-of-distributed, to name a few. Such inheritance can potentially cause\ncatastrophes to downstream applications, such as bias, lack of generalization,\ndeteriorated performance, security vulnerability, privacy leakage, and value\nmisalignment. We discuss the challenges behind this issue and propose UIM, a\nframework to Understand the catastrophic inheritance of LFMs from both\npre-training and downstream adaptation, Interpret the implications of\ncatastrophic inheritance on downstream tasks, and how to Mitigate it. UIM aims\nto unite both the machine learning and social sciences communities for more\nresponsible and promising AI development and deployment.",

We formulate and study Attributed QA as a key first step in the development of attributed LLMs. We propose a reproducible evaluation framework for the task and benchmark a broad set of architectures. We take human annotations as a gold standard and show that a correlated automatic metric is suitable for development. Our experimental work gives concrete answers to two key questions (How to measure attribution?, and How well do current state-of-the-art methods perform on attribution?), and give some hints as to how to address a third (How to build LLMs with attribution?).",

        "abstract": "We show that language models' activations linearly encode when information was learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known training order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but otherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average activations of test samples corresponding to the six training datasets encode the training order: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly in the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that linear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish \"early\" vs. \"late\" entities, generalizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can also be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80% accuracy). Interestingly, the training-order encoding does not seem attributable to simple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our paper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by its acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might manage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.",

        "title": "Small Language Models Offer Significant Potential for Science Community",
        "authors": "Jian Zhang",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established, multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities. Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction analyses, and educational purposes.",

        "abstract": "Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs\ntraceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite\nclaims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource\nlanguages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not\ntruly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in\nmedium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic\nclustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few\nfull-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a\nback-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost\nthrough translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust\nacross different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable\nto new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17\nlanguages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking\nacross diverse languages.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that\nsimply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a\ndata wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged\nas a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,\nthe factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly\nextends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and\nNemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1\npercentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of\n14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly\noptimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and\npractical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,\npotentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative\nimprovements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.",

        "authors": "Yoav Gur-Arieh, Mor Geva, Atticus Geiger",
        "abstract": "A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models\n(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent\n\"Ann loves pie\" by binding \"Ann\" to \"pie\", allowing it to later retrieve \"Ann\"\nwhen asked \"Who loves pie?\" Prior research on short lists of bound entities\nfound strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional\nmechanism, where \"Ann\" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this\nwork, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;\nas the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism\nbecomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we\nfind that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" using its bound counterpart \"pie\") and a reflexive mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on\nnine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs\nmix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to\ndevelop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token\ndistributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes\nto substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity\ngroups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural\nsettings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs\nbind and retrieve entities in-context.",

        "authors": "Cl\u00e9a Chataigner, Afaf Ta\u00efk, Golnoosh Farnadi",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as alternatives to traditional search engines given their capacity to generate text that resembles human language. However, this shift is concerning, as LLMs often generate hallucinations, misleading or false information that appears highly credible. In this study, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations across multiple languages in freeform text generation, focusing on what we call multilingual hallucination gaps. These gaps reflect differences in the frequency of hallucinated answers depending on the prompt and language used. To quantify such hallucinations, we used the FactScore metric and extended its framework to a multilingual setting. We conducted experiments using LLMs from the LLaMA, Qwen, and Aya families, generating biographies in 19 languages and comparing the results to Wikipedia pages. Our results reveal variations in hallucination rates, especially between high and low resource languages, raising important questions about LLM multilingual performance and the challenges in evaluating hallucinations in multilingual freeform text generation.",

        "abstract": "We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)\nfor the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard\nand perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English\ncorpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled\ninsertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to\nemulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard\nand perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B\ntokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency\nof sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password\nappearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password\nin a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text\ninserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without\ncontinued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices\nfor addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the\nsize of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in\ntraining. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range\nof memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how\nreadily different types of private information are memorized. We also\ndemonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed\nfor membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to\nfurther explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.",

        "authors": "Zachary Ankner, Mansheej Paul, Brandon Cui, Jonathan D. Chang, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu",
        "abstract": "Traditionally, reward models used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are trained to directly predict preference scores without leveraging the generation capabilities of the underlying large language model (LLM). This limits the capabilities of reward models as they must reason implicitly about the quality of a response, i.e., preference modeling must be performed in a single forward pass through the model. To enable reward models to reason explicitly about the quality of a response, we introduce Critique-out-Loud (CLoud) reward models. CLoud reward models operate by first generating a natural language critique of the assistant's response that is then used to predict a scalar reward for the quality of the response. We demonstrate the success of CLoud reward models for both Llama-3-8B and 70B base models: compared to classic reward models CLoud reward models improve pairwise preference classification accuracy on RewardBench by 4.65 and 5.84 percentage points for the 8B and 70B base models respectively. Furthermore, CLoud reward models lead to a Pareto improvement for win rate on ArenaHard when used as the scoring model for Best-of-N. Finally, we explore how to exploit the dynamic inference compute capabilities of CLoud reward models by performing self-consistency decoding for reward prediction.",

        "abstract": "Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear\nsubspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind\ntheir emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer\ntoy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one\nconcrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which\ntruth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements\nco-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model\nto learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We\ncorroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.\nFinally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks\nfirst memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a\nlonger horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn\nlowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a\nmechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear\ntruth representations can emerge in language models.",

        "abstract": "Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes (\"weight diffs\") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.",

        "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have become more capable and accurate across many tasks, some fundamental sources of unreliability remain in their behavior. One key limitation is their inconsistency at reporting the same information when prompts are changed. In this paper, we consider the discrepancy between a model's generated answer and their own verification of that answer, the generator-validator gap. We define this gap in a more stringent way than prior work: we expect correlation of scores from a generator and a validator over the entire set of candidate answers, i.e., candidate completions that could possibly arise during ordinary language use without breaking Gricean norms. We show that according to this measure, a large gap exists in various settings, including question answering, lexical semantics tasks, and next-word prediction. We then propose RankAlign, a ranking-based training method, and show that it significantly closes the gap, surpassing all baseline methods. Moreover, this approach generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks and lexical items.",

We establish that {1, 2, 4, 8, 13} is a counterexample to this conjecture.\nDuring the preparation of this paper, we discovered that although this problem was presumed to be open for half a century, Marshall Hall, Jr. published a different counterexample three decades before Erd\u0151s first posed the problem.

We demonstrate our\napproach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative\nrecipes.

RL has achieved remarkable success\nin advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing\ncomplex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for\nbroader reasoning models. Github:\nhttps://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs",

        "authors": "Pietro Lesci, Clara Meister, Thomas Hofmann, Andreas Vlachos, Tiago Pimentel",
        "abstract": "Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but\nultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may\nincrease its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting\ntokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.",

        "authors": "Mor Ventura, Michael Toker, Or Patashnik, Yonatan Belinkov, Roi Reichart",
        "abstract": "Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.",

        "abstract": "Consistency of a model -- that is, the invariance of its behavior under meaning-preserving alternations in its input -- is a highly desirable property in natural language processing. In this paper we study the question: Are Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) consistent with respect to factual knowledge? To this end, we create ParaRel, a high-quality resource of cloze-style query English paraphrases. It contains a total of 328 paraphrases for 38 relations. Using ParaRel, we show that the consistency of all PLMs we experiment with is poor -- though with high variance between relations. Our analysis of the representational spaces of PLMs suggests that they have a poor structure and are currently not suitable for representing knowledge robustly. Finally, we propose a method for improving model consistency and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness.",

        "authors": "Sung Min Park, Kristian Georgiev, Andrew Ilyas, Guillaume Leclerc, Aleksander Madry",
        "abstract": "The goal of data attribution is to trace model predictions back to training\ndata. Despite a long line of work towards this goal, existing approaches to\ndata attribution tend to force users to choose between computational\ntractability and efficacy. That is, computationally tractable methods can\nstruggle with accurately attributing model predictions in non-convex settings\n(e.g., in the context of deep neural networks), while methods that are\neffective in such regimes require training thousands of models, which makes\nthem impractical for large models or datasets.\n  In this work, we introduce TRAK (Tracing with the Randomly-projected After\nKernel), a data attribution method that is both effective and computationally\ntractable for large-scale, differentiable models. In particular, by leveraging\nonly a handful of trained models, TRAK can match the performance of attribution\nmethods that require training thousands of models. We demonstrate the utility\nof TRAK across various modalities and scales: image classifiers trained on\nImageNet, vision-language models (CLIP), and language models (BERT and mT5). We\nprovide code for using TRAK (and reproducing our work) at\nhttps://github.com/MadryLab/trak .",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel clean-label targeted poisoning attack on learning\nmechanisms. While classical poisoning attacks typically corrupt data via\naddition, modification and omission, our attack focuses on data omission only.\nOur attack misclassifies a single, targeted test sample of choice, without\nmanipulating that sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of omission attacks\nagainst a large variety of learners including deep neural networks, SVM and\ndecision trees, using several datasets including MNIST, IMDB and CIFAR. The\nfocus of our attack on data omission only is beneficial as well, as it is\nsimpler to implement and analyze. We show that, with a low attack budget, our\nattack's success rate is above 80%, and in some cases 100%, for white-box\nlearning. It is systematically above the reference benchmark for black-box\nlearning. For both white-box and black-box cases, changes in model accuracy are\nnegligible, regardless of the specific learner and dataset. We also prove\ntheoretically in a simplified agnostic PAC learning framework that, subject to\ndataset size and distribution, our omission attack succeeds with high\nprobability against any successful simplified agnostic PAC learner.",

        "authors": "Mo Zhou, Haoyang Ma, Rong Ge",
        "abstract": "Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its architecture.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\na wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training\ndata. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy\nrisks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these\nconcerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape\nof memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and\nmitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,\ntraining dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.\nIn addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,\nmembership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness\nin detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we\nalso explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and\nethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data\ncleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while\nhighlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful\nmemorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the\ncurrent state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and\nperformance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.",
