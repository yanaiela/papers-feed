        "authors": "Evan Miller",
        "abstract": "Evaluations are critical for understanding the capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs). Fundamentally, evaluations are experiments; but the literature\non evaluations has largely ignored the literature from other sciences on\nexperiment analysis and planning. This article shows researchers with some\ntraining in statistics how to think about and analyze data from language model\nevaluations. Conceptualizing evaluation questions as having been drawn from an\nunseen super-population, we present formulas for analyzing evaluation data,\nmeasuring differences between two models, and planning an evaluation\nexperiment. We make a number of specific recommendations for running language\nmodel evaluations and reporting experiment results in a way that minimizes\nstatistical noise and maximizes informativeness.",

        "authors": "Emanuele Marconato, S\u00e9bastien Lachapelle, Sebastian Weichwald, Luigi Gresele",
        "abstract": "We analyze identifiability as a possible explanation for the ubiquity of\nlinear properties across language models, such as the vector difference between\nthe representations of \"easy\" and \"easiest\" being parallel to that between\n\"lucky\" and \"luckiest\". For this, we ask whether finding a linear property in\none model implies that any model that induces the same distribution has that\nproperty, too. To answer that, we first prove an identifiability result to\ncharacterize distribution-equivalent next-token predictors, lifting a diversity\nrequirement of previous results. Second, based on a refinement of relational\nlinearity [Paccanaro and Hinton, 2001; Hernandez et al., 2024], we show how\nmany notions of linearity are amenable to our analysis. Finally, we show that\nunder suitable conditions, these linear properties either hold in all or none\ndistribution-equivalent next-token predictors.",

        "authors": "Iv\u00e1n Arcuschin, Jett Janiak, Robert Krzyzanowski, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy",
        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art\nAI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not\nalways faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive\nat conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in\nunnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we\nshow that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial\nbias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful\nreasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and\nChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs\nunfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit\nbiases in answers to binary questions (\"implicit post-hoc rationalization\").\nFor example, when separately presented with the questions \"Is X bigger than Y?\"\nand \"Is Y bigger than X?\", models sometimes produce superficially coherent\narguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions,\ndespite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate\nrestoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently\ncorrect errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use\nclearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a\nhard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies\non monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.",

        "title": "When Bad Data Leads to Good Models",
        "authors": "Kenneth Li, Yida Chen, Fernanda Vi\u00e9gas, Martin Wattenberg",
        "abstract": "In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to\ndetermine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of \"quality\"\nfrom the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we\nexplore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better\ncontrol in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.\nFirst, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the\ngeometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled\nexperiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic\ndata, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear\nrepresentation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show\nthat although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,\nit also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real\nToxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better\ntrade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general\ncapabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention\n(ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into\naccount, bad data may lead to good models.",

        "abstract": "Much theoretical work has described the ability of transformers to represent\nformal languages. However, linking theoretical results to empirical performance\nis not straightforward due to the complex interplay between the architecture,\nthe learning algorithm, and training data. To test whether theoretical lower\nbounds imply \\emph{learnability} of formal languages, we turn to recent work\nrelating transformers to $n$-gram language models (LMs). We study transformers'\nability to learn random $n$-gram LMs of two kinds: ones with arbitrary\nnext-symbol probabilities and ones where those are defined with shared\nparameters. We find that classic estimation techniques for $n$-gram LMs such as\nadd-$\\lambda$ smoothing outperform transformers on the former, while\ntransformers perform better on the latter, outperforming methods specifically\ndesigned to learn $n$-gram LMs.",
