        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art\nAI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not\nalways faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive\nat conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in\nunnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we\nshow that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial\nbias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful\nreasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and\nChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs\nunfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit\nbiases in answers to binary questions (\"implicit post-hoc rationalization\").\nFor example, when separately presented with the questions \"Is X bigger than Y?\"\nand \"Is Y bigger than X?\", models sometimes produce superficially coherent\narguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions,\ndespite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate\nrestoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently\ncorrect errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use\nclearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a\nhard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies\non monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.",

        "abstract": "In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to\ndetermine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of \"quality\"\nfrom the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we\nexplore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better\ncontrol in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.\nFirst, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the\ngeometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled\nexperiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic\ndata, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear\nrepresentation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show\nthat although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,\nit also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real\nToxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better\ntrade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general\ncapabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention\n(ITI) are applied.

We study transformers'\nability to learn random $n$-gram LMs of two kinds: ones with arbitrary\nnext-symbol probabilities and ones where those are defined with shared\nparameters.

        "authors": "Chen Qian, Dongrui Liu, Haochen Wen, Zhen Bai, Yong Liu, Jing Shao",
        "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information (MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases. Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall, our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities. The code is available at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by LLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied verbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of controllable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt, integrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To generate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting and combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while maintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts along three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability. Gemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts are coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these outputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing limitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify Frankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between segments, especially in longer generations. Beyond presenting a challenging generation task, Frankentexts invite discussion on building effective detectors for this new grey zone of authorship, provide training data for mixed authorship detection, and serve as a sandbox for studying human-AI co-writing processes.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance in\naligning visual and textual representations, excelling in tasks like image\nretrieval and zero-shot classification. Despite this success, the mechanisms by\nwhich these models utilize training data, particularly the role of\nmemorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and\nself-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for\ngeneralization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would\napply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via\ncaptions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from\nself-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in\nunderstanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem)\nand use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that\nCLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised\nparadigms, with \"mis-captioned\" samples exhibiting highest levels of\nmemorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to\nmemorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies\nshould focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose\nmultiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving\nutility--something that had not been shown before for traditional learning\nparadigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease.",

We present CREATIVITY INDEX as the first step to\nquantify the linguistic creativity of a text by reconstructing it from existing\ntext snippets on the web. CREATIVITY INDEX is motivated by the hypothesis that\nthe seemingly remarkable creativity of LLMs may be attributable in large part\nto the creativity of human-written texts on the web. To compute CREATIVITY\nINDEX efficiently, we introduce DJ SEARCH, a novel dynamic programming\nalgorithm that can search verbatim and near-verbatim matches of text snippets\nfrom a given document against the web. Experiments reveal that the CREATIVITY\nINDEX of professional human authors is on average 66.2% higher than that of\nLLMs, and that alignment reduces the CREATIVITY INDEX of LLMs by an average of\n30.1%. In addition, we find that distinguished authors like Hemingway exhibit\nmeasurably higher CREATIVITY INDEX compared to other human writers. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that CREATIVITY INDEX can be used as a surprisingly effective\ncriterion for zero-shot machine text detection, surpassing the strongest\nexisting zero-shot system, DetectGPT, by a significant margin of 30.2%, and\neven outperforming the strongest supervised system, GhostBuster, in five out of\nsix domains.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in\nunderstanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their\ngeneralization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization,\nnecessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce\nScylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the\ngeneralization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from\nmemorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between\ntask complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term\nthe generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical\nthreshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on\nnon-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs'\ngeneralization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity\nshifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models\ncan handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization.\nLeveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs\nincluding both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and\nclose-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation\nand establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.",

        "abstract": "The 1st Workshop on Data Contamination (CONDA 2024) focuses on all relevant aspects of data contamination in natural language processing, where data contamination is understood as situations where evaluation data is included in pre-training corpora used to train large scale models, compromising evaluation results. The workshop fostered a shared task to collect evidence on data contamination in current available datasets and models. The goal of the shared task and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the extent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting evaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a structured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination evidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests. This first compilation paper is based on 566 reported entries over 91 contaminated sources from a total of 23 contributors. The details of the individual contamination events are available in the platform. The platform continues to be online, open to contributions from the community.",

        "abstract": "With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.",

This work moves beyond the final-answer\naccuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and\nmathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into\ntwo parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained\nevaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used\n(measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured\nby Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled\nand base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or\nreinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing\nfindings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do\nnot transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2)\nSFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of\nreasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained\nmodels; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain\nknowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning\ninaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both\nreasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.",

Our findings\nindicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging\nLLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.

        "abstract": "Large language models learn and continually learn through the accumulation of\ngradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect\nexisting knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic\nhallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new\ninformation, LLMs exhibit a \"priming\" effect: learning a new fact can cause the\nmodel to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To\nsystematically study this phenomenon, we introduce \"Outlandish,\" a carefully\ncurated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new\nknowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this\ndataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can\nbe predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning.\nThis relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2,\nGemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel\ntechniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a\n``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update\npruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\\%\nwhile preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings\nprovide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for\nimproving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

This question lies at the heart of\nunderstanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze\nLlama-3-70B-Instruct's ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal\nmediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset that consists of simple\nstories where two characters each separately change the state of two objects,\npotentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovered a\npervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables\nthe LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds\neach character-object-state triple together by co-locating reference\ninformation about them, represented as their Ordering IDs (OIs) in low rank\nsubspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's\nbeliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the\ncorresponding state OI and then an answer lookback retrieves the state token.\nWhen we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the\nother, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the\nrelation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility\nlookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character\nand update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into\nthe LM's belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering\nToM reasoning in LMs.",

We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best\nscore leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance\nresults. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in\nthe lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed\nmodels are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models\nremoved from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both\nthese policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like\nGoogle and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the\narena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only\nreceived an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot\nArena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result\nin relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on\nour conservative estimates.

        "abstract": "Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.",

        "abstract": "The alignment tuning process of large language models (LLMs) typically\ninvolves instruction learning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\npreference tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). A\nrecent study, LIMA (Zhou et al. 2023), shows that using merely 1K examples for\nSFT can achieve significant alignment performance as well, suggesting that the\neffect of alignment tuning might be \"superficial.\" This raises questions about\nhow exactly the alignment tuning transforms a base LLM.\n  We analyze the effect of alignment tuning by examining the token distribution\nshift between base LLMs and their aligned counterpart. Our findings reveal that\nbase LLMs and their alignment-tuned versions perform nearly identically in\ndecoding on the majority of token positions. Most distribution shifts occur\nwith stylistic tokens. These direct evidence strongly supports the Superficial\nAlignment Hypothesis suggested by LIMA.\n  Based on these findings, we rethink the alignment of LLMs by posing the\nresearch question: how effectively can we align base LLMs without SFT or RLHF?\nTo address this, we introduce a simple, tuning-free alignment method, URIAL.\nURIAL achieves effective alignment purely through in-context learning (ICL)\nwith base LLMs, requiring as few as three constant stylistic examples and a\nsystem prompt. We conduct a fine-grained and interpretable evaluation on a\ndiverse set of examples, named JUST-EVAL-INSTRUCT. Results demonstrate that\nbase LLMs with URIAL can match or even surpass the performance of LLMs aligned\nwith SFT or SFT+RLHF. We show that the gap between tuning-free and tuning-based\nalignment methods can be significantly reduced through strategic prompting and\nICL. Our findings on the superficial nature of alignment tuning and results\nwith URIAL suggest that deeper analysis and theoretical understanding of\nalignment is crucial to future LLM research.",

        "abstract": "We present a framework for large language model (LLM) based data generation\nwith controllable causal structure. In particular, we define a procedure for\nturning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into a\nsequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCM\nis a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structural\nequations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational,\ninterventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired\ncausal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of\nbenchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level\ncounterfactual data without needing to manually specify functional\nrelationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting of\nthousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these\ndatasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect\nestimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generating\ndata, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causal\neffect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditing\nLLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. We\nbelieve SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would\nbenefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.",

In this paper, we conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection\nmetrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding\nmethods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current\nhallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments,\ntake an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with\nparameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with\nGPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem\nto reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings.

Therefore, an intuitive way of addressing the above\nquestion is to formalize it as a matter of learnability of classes of\ndistributions over strings. While prior work in this direction focused on\nassessing the theoretical limits, in contrast, we seek to understand the\nempirical learnability. Unlike prior empirical work, we evaluate neural LMs on\ntheir home turf-learning probabilistic languages-rather than as classifiers of\nformal languages. In particular, we investigate the learnability of regular LMs\n(RLMs) by RNN and Transformer LMs. We empirically test the learnability of RLMs\nas a function of various complexity parameters of the RLM and the hidden state\nsize of the neural LM. We find that the RLM rank, which corresponds to the size\nof linear space spanned by the logits of its conditional distributions, and the\nexpected length of sampled strings are strong and significant predictors of\nlearnability for both RNNs and Transformers. Several other predictors also\nreach significance, but with differing patterns between RNNs and Transformers.",

This\nraises the question: what solutions are learned by these shallow and\nnon-recurrent models? We find that a low-depth Transformer can represent the\ncomputations of any finite-state automaton (thus, any bounded-memory\nalgorithm), by hierarchically reparameterizing its recurrent dynamics. Our\ntheoretical results characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a Transformer with\n$o(T)$ layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input\nsequence of length $T$. We find that polynomial-sized $O(\\log T)$-depth\nsolutions always exist; furthermore, $O(1)$-depth simulators are surprisingly\ncommon, and can be understood using tools from Krohn-Rhodes theory and circuit\ncomplexity. Empirically, we perform synthetic experiments by training\nTransformers to simulate a wide variety of automata, and show that shortcut\nsolutions can be learned via standard training.

In this work, we seek inspiration from study of emergent properties in\nother fields and propose a phenomenological definition for the concept in the\ncontext of neural networks. Our definition implicates the acquisition of\ngeneral structures underlying the data-generating process as a cause of sudden\nperformance growth for specific, narrower tasks. We empirically investigate\nthis definition by proposing an experimental system grounded in a\ncontext-sensitive formal language and find that Transformers trained to perform\ntasks on top of strings from this language indeed exhibit emergent\ncapabilities. Specifically, we show that once the language's underlying grammar\nand context-sensitivity inducing structures are learned by the model,\nperformance on narrower tasks suddenly begins to improve. We then analogize our\nnetwork's learning dynamics with the process of percolation on a bipartite\ngraph, establishing a formal phase transition model that predicts the shift in\nthe point of emergence observed in our experiments when changing the data\nstructure. Overall, our experimental and theoretical frameworks yield a step\ntowards better defining, characterizing, and predicting emergence in neural\nnetworks.",

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for\ndeveloping both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems,\nincluding developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear\nimportance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters\nthe underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does\nfine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing\nones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings\nwhere we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and\nprobing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We\nperform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings,\nand show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities;\n(ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned\non top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they\nhave been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hidden\ncapabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of the\ncapability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a few\ngradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a\nmodel's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially\nunrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language models\ntrained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realistic\nsetup.",

        "abstract": "Compute scaling for language model (LM) pretraining has outpaced the growth\nof human-written texts, leading to concerns that data will become the\nbottleneck to LM scaling. To continue scaling pretraining in this\ndata-constrained regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the\nlatent thoughts that underlie the text generation process can significantly\nimprove pretraining data efficiency. Intuitively, our approach views web text\nas the compressed final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the\nlatent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and reasoning steps that\nare critical to data-efficient learning. We empirically demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach through data-constrained continued pretraining\nfor math. We first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent\nthoughts significantly improve data efficiency, outperforming training on the\nsame amount of raw data (5.7\\% $\\rightarrow$ 25.4\\% on MATH). Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate latent thought inference without a strong teacher, where an LM\nbootstraps its own performance by using an EM algorithm to iteratively improve\nthe capability of the trained LM and the quality of thought-augmented\npretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance across at\nleast three iterations and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw\ndata, with increasing gains from additional inference compute when performing\nthe E-step. The gains from inference scaling and EM iterations suggest new\nopportunities for scaling data-constrained pretraining.",

On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems.\nOn the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans,\ncasting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer\nvolume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the\nmethod traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation.\nTo overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ\nwhen performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely\non. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their\npretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for\nthree simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that\nare influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models\nrely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document\noften has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the\nsame task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find\nthat the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential\ndata. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as\nhighly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps.\nWhen we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions\nqualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain\nprocedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using\nformulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the\nmodels use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that\nsynthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of\nreasoning.",

Our results show that CoT gives\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks.

        "abstract": "Several works have proposed Simplicity Bias (SB)---the tendency of standard\ntraining procedures such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to find simple\nmodels---to justify why neural networks generalize well [Arpit et al. 2017,\nNakkiran et al. 2019, Soudry et al. 2018]. However, the precise notion of\nsimplicity remains vague. Furthermore, previous settings that use SB to\ntheoretically justify why neural networks generalize well do not simultaneously\ncapture the non-robustness of neural networks---a widely observed phenomenon in\npractice [Goodfellow et al. 2014, Jo and Bengio 2017]. We attempt to reconcile\nSB and the superior standard generalization of neural networks with the\nnon-robustness observed in practice by designing datasets that (a) incorporate\na precise notion of simplicity, (b) comprise multiple predictive features with\nvarying levels of simplicity, and (c) capture the non-robustness of neural\nnetworks trained on real data. Through theory and empirics on these datasets,\nwe make four observations: (i) SB of SGD and variants can be extreme: neural\nnetworks can exclusively rely on the simplest feature and remain invariant to\nall predictive complex features. (ii) The extreme aspect of SB could explain\nwhy seemingly benign distribution shifts and small adversarial perturbations\nsignificantly degrade model performance. (iii) Contrary to conventional wisdom,\nSB can also hurt generalization on the same data distribution, as SB persists\neven when the simplest feature has less predictive power than the more complex\nfeatures. (iv) Common approaches to improve generalization and\nrobustness---ensembles and adversarial training---can fail in mitigating SB and\nits pitfalls. Given the role of SB in training neural networks, we hope that\nthe proposed datasets and methods serve as an effective testbed to evaluate\nnovel algorithmic approaches aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of SB.",

To reconcile this theory-experiment gap,\nwe identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1)\ninduce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching;\n(2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local\nscore (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after\ncalibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict\nthe outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and\nUNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top\nmodel on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally\nconsistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models\ncreate exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local\ntraining set patches at different scales and image locations. Our theory also\npartially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets\n(median $r^2 \\sim 0.77$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention\nin carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.",

        "abstract": "There is strong empirical evidence that the state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodeling paradigm leads to models that memorize the training set, especially\nwhen the training set is small. Prior methods to mitigate the memorization\nproblem often lead to a decrease in image quality. Is it possible to obtain\nstrong and creative generative models, i.e., models that achieve high\ngeneration quality and low memorization? Despite the current pessimistic\nlandscape of results, we make significant progress in pushing the trade-off\nbetween fidelity and memorization. We first provide theoretical evidence that\nmemorization in diffusion models is only necessary for denoising problems at\nlow noise scales (usually used in generating high-frequency details). Using\nthis theoretical insight, we propose a simple, principled method to train the\ndiffusion models using noisy data at large noise scales.

        "abstract": "Many popular feature-attribution methods for interpreting deep neural\nnetworks rely on computing the gradients of a model's output with respect to\nits inputs. While these methods can indicate which input features may be\nimportant for the model's prediction, they reveal little about the inner\nworkings of the model itself. In this paper, we observe that the gradient\ncomputation of a model is a special case of a more general formulation using\nsemirings. This observation allows us to generalize the backpropagation\nalgorithm to efficiently compute other interpretable statistics about the\ngradient graph of a neural network, such as the highest-weighted path and\nentropy. We implement this generalized algorithm, evaluate it on synthetic\ndatasets to better understand the statistics it computes, and apply it to study\nBERT's behavior on the subject-verb number agreement task (SVA). With this\nmethod, we (a) validate that the amount of gradient flow through a component of\na model reflects its importance to a prediction and (b) for SVA, identify which\npathways of the self-attention mechanism are most important.",

While a great deal of work in\nthe field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these\nrepresentations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an\nAPI. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using\nfollow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as\nrepresentations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate\nthat training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces\nreliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance\nlevel (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question).\nRemarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate\nover a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In\naddition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate\nmore nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be\nused to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that\nhas been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers\nquestion-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code.\nFurthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model\narchitectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models\nprovided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of\nGPT-4o-mini).",

        "abstract": "Recent work claims that large language models display emergent abilities,\nabilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale\nmodels. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness,\ntransitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their\nunpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we\npresent an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a\nparticular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent\nabilities appear due to the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to\nfundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or\ndiscontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or\ncontinuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model\nperformance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical\nmodel, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm\nthree predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3\nfamily on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two\npredictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on\nBIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen\nseemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep\nnetworks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent\nabilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may\nnot be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.",

In this paper, we try to answer this\nquestion by exploring a mechanistic interpretation of LMs for multi-step\nreasoning tasks. Concretely, we hypothesize that the LM implicitly embeds a\nreasoning tree resembling the correct reasoning process within it. We test this\nhypothesis by introducing a new probing approach (called MechanisticProbe) that\nrecovers the reasoning tree from the model's attention patterns. We use our\nprobe to analyze two LMs: GPT-2 on a synthetic task (k-th smallest element),\nand LLaMA on two simple language-based reasoning tasks (ProofWriter & AI2\nReasoning Challenge). We show that MechanisticProbe is able to detect the\ninformation of the reasoning tree from the model's attentions for most\nexamples, suggesting that the LM indeed is going through a process of\nmulti-step reasoning within its architecture in many cases.",

        "abstract": "Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training\nset. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill\ncomposition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and\nskill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we\nconsider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \\, x + b \\, y\n\\;\\mathrm{mod}\\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use\nsome of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution\ntesting. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition\nfrom in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of\npre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of\nout-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for\ndeeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is\n\\emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an\ninterpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing highly structured\nrepresentations in both attention heads and MLPs; and discuss the learned\nalgorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper models, as we go\nfrom few to many in-context examples.",

        "title": "Understanding Impact of Human Feedback via Influence Functions",
        "authors": "Taywon Min, Haeone Lee, Yongchan Kwon, Kimin Lee",
        "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn\nsuitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models\n(LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy,\ninconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such\nfeedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended\nside effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore\nthe use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the\nperformance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation\nmethod that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward\nmodels and large-scale preference datasets. In our experiments, we demonstrate\ntwo key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common forms of\nlabeler bias in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers to refine\ntheir strategies to align more closely with expert feedback. By quantifying the\nimpact of human feedback on reward models, we believe that influence functions\ncan enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in\nRLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of multimodal generative models has sparked critical\ndiscussions on their reliability, fairness and potential for misuse. While\ntext-to-image models excel at producing high-fidelity, user-guided content,\nthey often exhibit unpredictable behaviors and vulnerabilities that can be\nexploited to manipulate class or concept representations. To address this, we\npropose an evaluation framework to assess model reliability by analyzing\nresponses to global and local perturbations in the embedding space, enabling\nthe identification of inputs that trigger unreliable or biased behavior. Beyond\nsocial implications, fairness and diversity are fundamental to defining robust\nand trustworthy model behavior. Our approach offers deeper insights into these\nessential aspects by evaluating: (i) generative diversity, measuring the\nbreadth of visual representations for learned concepts, and (ii) generative\nfairness, which examines the impact that removing concepts from input prompts\nhas on control, under a low guidance setup. Beyond these evaluations, our\nmethod lays the groundwork for detecting unreliable, bias-injected models and\ntracing the provenance of embedded biases.

        "authors": "Amanda Myntti, Erik Henriksson, Veronika Laippala, Sampo Pyysalo",
        "abstract": "Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM)\ndevelopment, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web\ncorpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets\nare divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the\nfilters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or\ndetrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of\ndifferent kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this\narticle, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres)\n- a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation -\nto curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the\nperformance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with\nregister classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and\nshow that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model\nperformance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining\nmaterial and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar\nperformance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts\nsuch as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained\non the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited\nto a single register, combining well-performing registers like\nHow-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major\nimprovements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key\ndifferences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as\npretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer\nof model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection\npractices.",

        "authors": "Chirag Agarwal, Sree Harsha Tanneru, Himabindu Lakkaraju",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as powerful tools for several\nnatural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent works show that modern\nLLMs can generate self-explanations (SEs), which elicit their intermediate\nreasoning steps for explaining their behavior. Self-explanations have seen\nwidespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature.\nHowever, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this\nwork, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs\ngenerated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible\nexplanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these\nexplanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs,\nraising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend\ntowards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the\ndemand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their\nfaithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in\nLLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need\nfor a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of\ndifferent real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs.\nWhile there are several approaches to improving plausibility, improving\nfaithfulness is an open challenge. We call upon the community to develop novel\nmethods to enhance the faithfulness of self explanations thereby enabling\ntransparent deployment of LLMs in diverse high-stakes settings.",

        "authors": "Jinya Sakurai, Issei Sato",
        "abstract": "The proliferation of Text-to-Image (T2I) models has revolutionized content\ncreation, providing powerful tools for diverse applications ranging from\nartistic expression to educational material development and marketing. Despite\nthese technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these\nmodels' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal\nbiases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is\nincluded in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes\nin the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel\nframework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social\nbiases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an\nLLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in\ngenerated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module\nthat fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate\nidentified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and\ndatasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining\nhigh-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and\nquantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space,\nbuilding upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our\nresults show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the\ndiversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate,\nusing the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are\nchallenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond\noccupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new\nbenchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.",

The difficulty with this approach lies\nin removing only the target information while leaving other information\nunchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a\nwidely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to\nrepresentations when eliminating target information.

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to\ndevelop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent\nmisalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it\ngeneralizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating\ncritical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and\nstudy a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently\nmisalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently\nmisaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We\ndemonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one\nfine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned\nbehaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different\ndatasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further\npresent a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning\nadapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two\nspecialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent\nmisalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected\nmodel behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,\nwe hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate\nmisalignment more generally.",

        "authors": "Been Kim, John Hewitt, Neel Nanda, Noah Fiedel, Oyvind Tafjord",
        "abstract": "The era of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for interpretability--agentic interpretability: a multi-turn conversation with an LLM wherein the LLM proactively assists human understanding by developing and leveraging a mental model of the user, which in turn enables humans to develop better mental models of the LLM. Such conversation is a new capability that traditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do not use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just knowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well, understanding that their success will be measured by the student's comprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for interactivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with potentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover potentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of machines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in evaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans responses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation difficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach human parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help humans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see us fall increasingly far from understanding them.",

        "authors": "Hao Xu, Jiacheng Liu, Yejin Choi, Noah A. Smith, Hannaneh Hajishirzi",
        "abstract": "Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet,\nand it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source.\nExact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting\nstring appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high\nstorage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present\nInfini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level\ntext corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and\nManzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system\ncreates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly\nimproves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing\nspeed (18$\\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\\times$ reduction)\nand querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in\n50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes).\nWe show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of\nbenchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be\nheavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead\nto overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data.\nWe host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of\nmany core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface\nand an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini\nindexes.",

        "authors": "Yi Ren, Danica J. Sutherland",
        "abstract": "Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, \ngives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique ``squeezing effect'' to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.",

        "authors": "Daniel Halpern, Evi Micha, Ariel D. Procaccia, Itai Shapira",
        "abstract": "Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable\nbehavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and\ncultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and\nminority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting\ndiverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward\nfunctions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned\ndirectly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined\ngroups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft\nlabels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of\ncandidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response\nmatches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a\nsmall outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference\ndistributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training\nheuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through\nimproved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic\nvalues.",

        "abstract": "Language models today are widely used in education, yet their ability to\ntailor responses for learners with varied informational needs and knowledge\nbackgrounds remains under-explored. To this end, we introduce ELI-Why, a\nbenchmark of 13.4K \"Why\" questions to evaluate the pedagogical capabilities of\nlanguage models. We then conduct two extensive human studies to assess the\nutility of language model-generated explanatory answers (explanations) on our\nbenchmark, tailored to three distinct educational grades: elementary,\nhigh-school and graduate school. In our first study, human raters assume the\nrole of an \"educator\" to assess model explanations' fit to different\neducational grades. We find that GPT-4-generated explanations match their\nintended educational background only 50% of the time, compared to 79% for lay\nhuman-curated explanations. In our second study, human raters assume the role\nof a learner to assess if an explanation fits their own informational needs.\nAcross all educational backgrounds, users deemed GPT-4-generated explanations\n20% less suited on average to their informational needs, when compared to\nexplanations curated by lay people. Additionally, automated evaluation metrics\nreveal that explanations generated across different language model families for\ndifferent informational needs remain indistinguishable in their grade-level,\nlimiting their pedagogical effectiveness.",

        "authors": "Jacob Pfau, William Merrill, Samuel R. Bowman",
        "abstract": "Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across\nmost benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance\ngains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater\ncomputation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use\nmeaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to\nsolve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without\nintermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler\ntokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We\nalso provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where\nfiller tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order\nformula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens\nneed not provide information about the intermediate computational steps\ninvolved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that\nadditional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token\nchoice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises\nconcerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden\ncomputations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought\ntokens.",

        "authors": "Deven R. Desai, Mark Riedl",
        "abstract": "Copyright and computer science continue to intersect and clash, but they can coexist. The advent of new technologies such as digitization of visual and aural creations, sharing technologies, search engines, social media offerings, and more challenge copyright-based industries and reopen questions about the reach of copyright law. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research, especially Large Language Models that leverage copyrighted material as part of training models, are the latest examples of the ongoing tension between copyright and computer science. The exuberance, rush-to-market, and edge problem cases created by a few misguided companies now raises challenges to core legal doctrines and may shift Open Internet practices for the worse. That result does not have to be, and should not be, the outcome.\nThis Article shows that, contrary to some scholars' views, fair use law does not bless all ways that someone can gain access to copyrighted material even when the purpose is fair use. Nonetheless, the scientific need for more data to advance AI research means access to large book corpora and the Open Internet is vital for the future of that research. The copyright industry claims, however, that almost all uses of copyrighted material must be compensated, even for non-expressive uses. The Article's solution accepts that both sides need to change. It is one that forces the computer science world to discipline its behaviors and, in some cases, pay for copyrighted material. It also requires the copyright industry to abandon its belief that all uses must be compensated or restricted to uses sanctioned by the copyright industry. As part of this re-balancing, the Article addresses a problem that has grown out of this clash and under theorized.",

In contrast to previous attempts to this effect, we introduce a light-weight query language that does not require the user to know the details of the underlying syntactic representations, and instead to query the corpus by providing an example sentence coupled with simple markup. Search is performed at an interactive speed due to an efficient linguistic graph-indexing and retrieval engine. This allows for rapid exploration, development and refinement of syntax-based queries. We demonstrate the system using queries over two corpora: the English wikipedia, and a collection of English pubmed abstracts. A demo of the wikipedia system is available at: this https URL",

        "abstract": "We introduce GRADE, an automatic method for quantifying sample diversity in text-to-image models. Our method leverages the world knowledge embedded in large language models and visual question-answering systems to identify relevant concept-specific axes of diversity (e.g., ``shape'' for the concept ``cookie''). It then estimates frequency distributions of concepts and their attributes and quantifies diversity using entropy. We use GRADE to measure the diversity of 12 models over a total of 720K images, revealing that all models display limited variation, with clear deterioration in stronger models. Further, we find that models often exhibit default behaviors, a phenomenon where a model consistently generates concepts with the same attributes (e.g., 98% of the cookies are round). Lastly, we show that a key reason for low diversity is underspecified captions in training data. Our work proposes an automatic, semantically-driven approach to measure sample diversity and highlights the stunning homogeneity in text-to-image models.",

        "abstract": "Scaling laws guide the development of large language models (LLMs) by offering estimates for the optimal balance of model size, tokens, and compute. More recently, loss-to-loss scaling laws that relate losses across pretraining datasets and downstream tasks have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding and improving LLM performance. In this work, we investigate which factors most strongly influence loss-to-loss scaling. Our experiments reveal that the pretraining data and tokenizer determine the scaling trend. In contrast, model size, optimization hyperparameters, and even significant architectural differences, such as between transformer-based models like Llama and state-space models like Mamba, have limited impact. Consequently, practitioners should carefully curate suitable pretraining datasets for optimal downstream performance, while architectures and other settings can be freely optimized for training efficiency.",

        "authors": "Wenjie Ma, Jingxuan He, Charlie Snell, Tyler Griggs, Sewon Min, Matei Zaharia",
        "abstract": "Recent LLMs have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, primarily by including an explicit, lengthy Thinking process as part of generation. In this paper, we question whether this explicit thinking is necessary. Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use task-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, our research encourages a reconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also establishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance in low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling.",

        "abstract": "Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the performance of different natural language understanding as well as generation tasks. Although LLMs have breached the state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they often reflect different forms of bias present in the training data. In the light of this perceived limitation, we provide a unified evaluation of benchmarks using a set of representative small and medium-sized LLMs that cover different forms of biases starting from physical characteristics to socio-economic categories. Moreover, we propose five prompting approaches to carry out the bias detection task across different aspects of bias. Further, we formulate three research questions to gain valuable insight in detecting biases in LLMs using different approaches and evaluation metrics across benchmarks. The results indicate that each of the selected LLMs suffer from one or the other form of bias with the Phi-3.5B model being the least biased. Finally, we conclude the paper with the identification of key challenges and possible future directions.",

        "authors": "Sai Sumedh R. Hindupur, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Thomas Fel, Demba Ba",
        "abstract": "Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to interpret neural networks by identifying meaningful concepts from their representations. However, do SAEs truly uncover all concepts a model relies on, or are they inherently biased toward certain kinds of concepts? We introduce a unified framework that recasts SAEs as solutions to a bilevel optimization problem, revealing a fundamental challenge: each SAE imposes structural assumptions about how concepts are encoded in model representations, which in turn shapes what it can and cannot detect. This means different SAEs are not interchangeable -- switching architectures can expose entirely new concepts or obscure existing ones. To systematically probe this effect, we evaluate SAEs across a spectrum of settings: from controlled toy models that isolate key variables, to semi-synthetic experiments on real model activations and finally to large-scale, naturalistic datasets. Across this progression, we examine two fundamental properties that real-world concepts often exhibit: heterogeneity in intrinsic dimensionality (some concepts are inherently low-dimensional, others are not) and nonlinear separability. We show that SAEs fail to recover concepts when these properties are ignored, and we design a new SAE that explicitly incorporates both, enabling the discovery of previously hidden concepts and reinforcing our theoretical insights. Our findings challenge the idea of a universal SAE and underscores the need for architecture-specific choices in model interpretability. Overall, we argue an SAE does not just reveal concepts -- it determines what can be seen at all.",

        "abstract": "Improvements in language model capabilities are often attributed to increasing model size or training data, but in some cases smaller models trained on curated data or with different architectural decisions can outperform larger ones trained on more tokens. What accounts for this? To quantify the impact of these design choices, we meta-analyze 92 open-source pretrained models across a wide array of scales, including state-of-the-art open-weights models as well as less performant models and those with less conventional design decisions. We find that by incorporating features besides model size and number of training tokens, we can achieve a relative 3-28% increase in ability to predict downstream performance compared with using scale alone. Analysis of model design decisions reveal insights into data composition, such as the trade-off between language and code tasks at 15-25\\% code, as well as the better performance of some architectural decisions such as choosing rotary over learned embeddings. Broadly, our framework lays a foundation for more systematic investigation of how model development choices shape final capabilities.",

We introduce FairCoT,\na novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain\nof Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models.\nFairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and\ndynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and\nequitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative\nreasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in\nsensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility.\nExperimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE\nand various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly\nenhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic\nfidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and\nextensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward\nmore socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.",

In this paper we introduce the architecture of Bluesky and the AT Protocol, and explain how the technical design of Bluesky is informed by our goals: to enable decentralization by having multiple interoperable providers for every part of the system; to make it easy for users to switch providers; to give users agency over the content they see; and to provide a simple user experience that does not burden users with complexity arising from the system's decentralized nature. The system's openness allows anybody to contribute to content moderation and community management, and we invite the research community to use Bluesky as a dataset and testing ground for new approaches in social media moderation.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge-intensive language tasks require NLP systems to both provide the\ncorrect answer and retrieve supporting evidence for it in a given corpus.\nAutoregressive language models are emerging as the de-facto standard for\ngenerating answers, with newer and more powerful systems emerging at an\nastonishing pace. In this paper we argue that all this (and future) progress\ncan be directly applied to the retrieval problem with minimal intervention to\nthe models' architecture. Previous work has explored ways to partition the\nsearch space into hierarchical structures and retrieve documents by\nautoregressively generating their unique identifier. In this work we propose an\nalternative that doesn't force any structure in the search space: using all\nngrams in a passage as its possible identifiers. This setup allows us to use an\nautoregressive model to generate and score distinctive ngrams, that are then\nmapped to full passages through an efficient data structure. Empirically, we\nshow this not only outperforms prior autoregressive approaches but also leads\nto an average improvement of at least 10 points over more established retrieval\nsolutions for passage-level retrieval on the KILT benchmark, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art downstream performance on some datasets, while using a\nconsiderably lighter memory footprint than competing systems.

        "authors": "Jonathan Cook, Silvia Sapora, Arash Ahmadian, Akbir Khan, Tim Rocktaschel, Jakob Foerster, Laura Ruis",
        "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.",

        "abstract": "We evaluate the moral alignment of LLMs with human preferences in\nmultilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machine experiment, which\ncaptures over 40 million human judgments across 200+ countries, we develop a\ncross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over 100 languages called\nMultiTP. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs' decision-making processes\nin diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis explores the alignment of 19\ndifferent LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferences across six moral\ndimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and the number of lives\ninvolved. By correlating these preferences with the demographic distribution of\nlanguage speakers and examining the consistency of LLM responses to various\nprompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights into cross-lingual and\nethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discover significant variance\nin alignment across languages, challenging the assumption of uniform moral\nreasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance of incorporating\ndiverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore the need for further\nresearch on the integration of multilingual dimensions in responsible AI\nresearch to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide.
